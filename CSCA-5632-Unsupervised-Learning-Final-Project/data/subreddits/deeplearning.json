Right now, we are entering the integration phase and we are encountering a problem that's giving us a hard time to fix: After modifying YOLOv10, we tried to run an inference in streamlit, but we got an error. The reason why we got an error is because we modify YOLOv10 with CARAFE. CARAFE is not a library included in YOLOv10 but we wanted to try to change the upsampling block in the head with CARAFE to see if it produces good results. But because of this, we don't know how to fix this problem. We are planning add an API to make things easier to run the inference in streamlit but we wanted to look for other solutions that are much more time efficient and effective.

It is a formalization of the process that LLM models utilize to actually construct language and interpret concepts. LLM models are next token predictors, even the most ardent critic would agree with that definition. The fact that they interpret language, can reason on some level, etc., these are emergent properties. So, where does the emergent property come from? What is the mechanism the model uses to create it? I spent two years trying to understand this question. I understand it now. The model turns its neural network into a graph like structure, but not a graph like we would typically interpret it. A fluid, multidimensional graph. The model plots concepts within this graph, they form emergent structures, the model 'reads' the patterns from these emergent structures. \n\nYou likely do not believe me simply from this explanation, so let me show you. If I am correct and the LLM model changes the 'shape' of the data as it learns, then I should be able to track and utilize those shape changes as a backpropagation training mechanism, right? Well guess what, I can do that! Entropy, Sparsity, and Density, this is how I can measure the shape of the data the LLM model is creating. Nodes, Clusters, and Edges, these are the mechanisms within the neural network the LLM model updates as it learns these concepts. I measure the effects of these updates, via Entropy, Sparsity, and Density. Check out more in this video: [https://youtu.be/jADTt5HHtiw](https://youtu.be/jADTt5HHtiw)",

        "We did hit a brick wall on learning as in more data doesn't improve the model performance, which is as simple as it sounds. The thing is, yes we've hit a brick wall in improving model performance, but we've barely scratched the surface on possible applications for this. Human-like robots are being developed and are a few years away from production, digital workers that are much better than humans will start doing a lot of jobs. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if an AI is now representing you in legal cases. Let's also move to optimization and edge distillation. People are now researching how to run these models on your phone. Right now to even run some of these models you need industrial level gpus, but in a few years each company will probably have a GPT clone that pretty much assists you in whatever you want. We don't need to make it smarter, we just need to finetune and optimize the models for specific situations.\n\nWe hit a brick wall in improving model performance, but we made a nuclear reactor and are currently using it to power a bike. We still didn't come to terms with the implication of what we actually developed and the age of AI just started."

        "I'm a bit confused on your question, but LSTM's are inherently sequential. So yes, you can input at most one token at a time. Then you could take the LSTMs output for the last token (30th day in your sequence) for the future prediction",
        "It can be used in both ways. The most common approach is let it process the entire the sequence to predict the next one like 30 days as inputs to predict the 31st, then in the next time step, put the 31st to the sequence and take the first one out.\n\nThe second approach is single input at once. The model will update the memory after a time step. Each time step is a single day and predict the 31st day after 30 time steps\n\nEdit: I just saw your additional code after done writing this comment. your code is taking the whole sequence to predict the next one (take 30 days at once, predict the 31st)",

Mac and Linux play well together given the Unix shared ancestor.",
        "IMO the Mac, it's what I recently went with precisely because the massive unified memory actually lets you experiment with models locally. The workflow I like is: make small model locally (within 64gb) and test it, adjust hyper-params, architectures, data processing etc to maximize performance, then when you want to scale the shit out of it you put you it up on your Linux A/H100 cluster, and do a short debugging session to go from the mps to  cuda backend (and most of that debugging session is just reinstalling all the python packages).",

Also, ok vram is important but I’m not confident that the training speed on the m4 is going to be reasonably close to the rtx. \nDid you check a deep learning-specific benchmark ?\n\nThe MacBook is an amazing machine, and it is probably the better computer between the two, but I would not recommend it as the primary/only machine to any of our students just for the vram.\n\nLet’s be honest tho, you are not going to regret either of the two purchases (and you’ll still need a Uni-provided server), so take more into account your preferred os and apps.",

Jokes aside, I agree with you. And yes for me too 8gb of vram are a strict constraint (I work in DL and computer vision field too).\n\nAfter this thread all those who work in DL confirm that the mac is superior. If someone had told me that the performance of the g16 (even with 8gb) was comparable to that of the mac then I would have continued to consider it.\n\nAs for now fuck the gaming part and let's go convince the PI and the head of reserch to buy me a 3.4k laptop out of noware lol",

I think the people who're suggesting the Zephyrus here have never actually used a Mac",

One MEPA I managed to buy the 3090 at msrp when there were none on the market, but it is way more common to overpay than to strike a good deal.",

Another thing is that my current desktop is the home pc so other components of the family work or game on it.\nMoreover for my phd i have a period abroad in another country and having a capable laptop will be a must.\n\nThe fact is that sticking to the mac m4 max (the model with 16 cpu and 32 gpu cores) and 36gb of unified memory, it will cost a wopping 3549, so more than putting money aside it would mean spending even more than I had planned",

This is meant to be a good representation of the token for finding which of the previous tokens are most important for a good prediction. Think of it as a literal query into a search engine like google.\n\nKeys: turns the token into a \"keyword\", for queries to search against. This is meant to be a good representation of the token so that when queries are multiplied by keys, the result is a number that signifies how important the token is in determining the representation of the current token. Think of it as keywords on websites that a search engine uses when determining the relevance of a website to a search query.\n\nValues: the true raw unweighted embedding representation of the vector. After using keys and queries to determine importance/attention weights, the weights are applied to the values in a weighted sum to get the final result. Think of it as the actual content of a website that's listed in search engine results.",

Projection is essentialy mapping as much of the information in the original embedding to another vector space (vector size). \n\nThe result of the dot product between Q and K is our Attention weights, we scale and softmax the weights to be between 0 and 1. The V is then multiplied by the attention weights and we get our attention context. \n\nIf you do cross-attention your Q input embedding is a different embedding from your K and V.\n\n\nEmbeddedings do not need to be inutialized randomly, they can be pre-trained representations of tokens or and output from an encoder.",

        "I like thinking about it from the perspective of a hashmap/dictionary. A hashmap takes a query, and matches it against stored hashed keys to return stored value. Hashmaps apply a hashing function to the query to derive what the value being matches to the keys. Imagine if the keys and values only were functions of the input, then rather than storing them explicitly you could just recompute them. So given a hashing function h for queries, and hashing function g to obtain the keys, and hashing function i for values, you could return I[x] if h[x] == g[x]  else return -1. \n\nNow imagine that instead of doing an exact match for the hashed query against stored keys, you want to do a more fuzzy/approximate match. This is where we get into the attention implement used in transformers. We transform the input into a query vector q = W_q * x, then since we don't want to explicitly store the large number of key values (KV cache aside), we recompute it as k = W_k * x. Now you do a similarity between queries and keys to match them by multiplication as q * k. Since we do not have a single value returned, we compute a distribution over the values obtained by multiplication i.e. the similarities of the queries and keys and pass it through a softmax to obtain a probability distribution. o = softmax (q * k). Next we compute the output values from our hashmap as v = W_v * x, and then return a weighted combination of result = v * o. Upto a normalising factor, the above describes the self attention mechanism. Now add gradient descent to the equation and you'll get the fact that keys, queries and values and learned during optimization.",

To draw analogies, the equivalent in binary classification would be the Jaccard index.\n\n\nThe reason why precision on the positive class is not used is because segmentation models are generally so good that mAP and similar metrics really don't tell you what a better model is.\n\n\nAnyways, medical imaging, specifically (cancer) cell detection/segmentation, uses the jaccard index as a KPI, which is IoU for the positive class."

[Would love to get your thoughts on the solution](https://solutions.cerbos.dev/authorization-in-rag-based-ai-systems-with-cerbos)**, if you have a moment.**\n\nLLMs leaking sensitive data is a bad scenario. Most architectures centralize data, which makes it hard to segregate specific data that AI models can access. And loading corporate data into a central vector store and using this alongside LLM, gives those interacting with the AI agent root-access to the entire dataset. Which means = privacy violation and compliance issues.\n\nHere is how it can be solved with permission-aware data filtering:\n\n* When a user asks a question, our solution - Cerbos, enforces existing permission policies to ensure the user has permission to invoke an agent. \n* Before retrieving data, Cerbos creates a query plan that defines which conditions must be applied when fetching data to ensure it is only the records the user can access based on their role, department, region, or other attributes.\n* Then Cerbos provides an authorization filter to limit the information fetched from your vector database or other data stores.\n* Allowed information is used by LLM to generate a response, making it relevant and fully compliant with user permissions.\n\nYou could use this functionality with our open source authorization solution, Cerbos PDP, [here’s our documentation. ](https://docs.cerbos.dev/cerbos/latest/recipes/ai/rag-authorization/)\n\n**If this is relevant to you, please share your thoughts on whether this could be a helpful solution to safeguarding RAG and LLMs :)**",

It's no more complicated than the ordinary derivative. But then from its definition you can derive formulas for composition of functions from vector spaces to vector spaces, and the derivative of a multiplication by a matrix follows easily. The difference is that your variable x is a vector. And the benefit is that you don't have to fully explicit the computations. You can stay at the same abstract level than matrix multiplication all along.",

I use the letter d since it is easier to write in this post. When x is fixed this function is linear in y. It is the slope of the function, but it not necessarily a scalar anymore, but a linear operator in general (matrix, tensor, Fourier transform, derivative, integral,...)\n\nIt approximates a smooth function by an affine function as follows for small y\n\nF(x + y) \\~= F(x) + dF(x).y\n\nTo give a practical example let's take the function F(x) = || A \\* x - b ||\\^2 which is the squared euclidean norm between A \\* x and b, where A is a matrix and b is a vector.\n\nMy goal will be to find the gradient direction to perform a gradient descent.\n\nBut first let's derive the analog of the derivative of a composed function, you'll see that it is almost exactly the same thought process than for scalar to scalar functions.\n\nLet's denote\n\nF(x) = G ( H (x) )\n\nwhere G is the squared norm  \nH(x) = A x - b\n\nLet's derive the formula of the derivative of the composition of two functions\n\nassuming y is small, but you can do it rigorously with the limit operator if you prefer to be more rigorous\n\ndF(x)y  \n= G(H(x + y)) - G(H(x))  \n= G(H(x) + dH(x)\\*y) - G(H(x))  \n= G(H(x)) + dG(H(x))\\*dH(x)\\*y - G(H(x))  \n= dG(H(x))\\*dH(x)\\*y\n\nNote that the order matters since it usually involves matrix or linear operators multiplications.\n\nOk now make it less abstract by replacing the values\n\ndH(x)\\*y  \n= A \\* (x + y) - A \\* x  \n= A \\* y\n\nOk, and now, using the fact that the norm can be expressed with the scalar product  \n< x ; x > = || x ||\\^2\n\nwe have\n\ndG(x)\\*y  \n= < x  + y ; x + y > - < x ; x >  \n= 2 < x ; y > + || y ||\\^2 but since we assumed that y is small\n\nwe get\n\ndG(x)\\*y = 2 < x ; y >\n\nNow, putting everything together we get\n\ndF(x)y  \n= dG(H(x))\\*dH(x)\\*y  \n= 2 < H(x) ; dH(x) \\* y >  \n= 2 < Ax - b ; A y >\n\nNice, we computed the gradient painlessly.\n\nNow, if I want to find the steepest descent, I can choose among all y of norm 1 the one that gives me the highest improvement, I just rewrite\n\n2 < Ax - b ; A y >  \n= 2   (Ax - b)\\^T \\* A \\* y  \n= c\\^T \\* y\n\nand the optimal y is equal to  \ny\\_optimal = - c/||c|| = - A\\^T(Ax - b)/||A\\^T(Ax - b)|| , by saturating the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality.\n\nWhich is exactly equal to the direction that is found with usual gradient as you did.\n\nI think this derivative makes things conceptually clearer since you stay at the same level of abstraction (here, matrices). It also makes the fomulae easier to implement.\n\nAlso, higher level derivatives can be obtained similarly."

        "I guess AI model distillation is only one of the steps I have first distilled model -> pruned model -> quantization I was able to reduce the size to 200KB from 1.8 MB and very less inference time while maintaining accuracy.\nI guess it's also depends upon what kind of a model we are talking about like classification model or generative model. I guess generative model are really hard to deploy on device I am not saying it is not possible but pretty hard to achieve where as classification model might be able to."

        "Hey there Stjepan,\n\nThanks for sharing this amazing resource! It sounds like a great read for anyone interested in expanding their knowledge in deep learning. François Chollet's work is always insightful and practical. I totally agree that \"Deep Learning with Python\" is a must-read for anyone delving into the field.\n\nOn a related note, it's fascinating to see how AI and deep learning technologies are shaping various aspects of our lives, from the way we interact with digital platforms to how we edit and manipulate visuals. For example, there are tools out there that can generate professional photos with your own AI model. You just upload a few selfies and the tool does the rest, creating unlimited on-brand photos.\n\nIt's not directly connected to deep learning, but it's another example of how AI is revolutionizing what we're capable of. Just a thought for anyone interested in the wider applications of AI and deep learning. \n\nWhat other resources would you recommend for someone diving into deep learning? Are there any specific projects or applications that you think really showcase the power of these technologies?\n\nCheers and thanks again for sharing!",

E.g. dataset A image 1 relates to dataset B image 1. Because of this relationship between images in each dataset, simply using database B for a pretrained model wouldn't leverage this relationship. What might be the best approach to train a U-Net on these two datasets? Note that I only want to predict on objects from dataset A, NOT dataset B. The point of this process is to determine if the features in dataset B can be used to assist learning of features in dataset A. My guess is that some sort of model with two input paths would be needed in the encoder and that the features from each input path would be concatenated at some point within the encoder.

I tend to flit from thing to thing, so I don't want to sink a lot of money into this, since, like my 3d printer, it might sit there unused after a short while.

I did see a 4060 ti 16gb for under $400, but then I saw a bunch of bad reviews and criticism, and wasn't sure, and now nothing is less than $450.  If I could pay $250 and go 17x faster than CPU, I would do that before paying $450 if a 25% gain over that.  If I have something really worth training I'll pay to have it done.

It's built for AI and deep learning tasks with its high CUDA core count and ample VRAM. \n\nHowever, your point about cost is valid. Cloud solutions can be expensive in the long run, but they offer flexibility and the opportunity to use high-end hardware without the upfront costs. If you're concerned about costs associated with iterations, I'd recommend starting with less complex models and smaller datasets, then gradually scaling up as needed. \n\nLastly, don't underestimate the power of optimizing your code.

The theory ive seen is that shallow networks learn low order patterns while deeper networks learn higher order patterns, and that the real generalizable patterns are the ones that are high-order, and lower level patterns are highly dependent on the data.",
        "Hey there! Great question. The choice between shallow and deep networks often depends on the complexity of the problem at hand. Shallow networks are generally simpler and less computationally demanding. They can be effective for problems with less complex patterns or correlations, which is why you might see them preferred in some research.\n\nDeep networks, on the other hand, are adept at handling more complex problems. Their capacity to overfit can indeed be a downside, but this is where techniques like regularization, dropout layers and early stopping come in handy. These methods can help manage overfitting by adding constraints to the network's complexity or by stopping training when the model starts to overperform on the training data.\n\nThe key is to find a balance that matches your specific task. It might take some experimenting with different architectures and techniques to find what works best for your data. Hope this helps!",

Overlapping patches at lower levels could definitely help capture finer details like transition timing, though you’re right that it might lead to overfitting, especially for tasks needing precise temporal data.

Your idea of combining both overlapping and sparse patches could actually be worth exploring in a GAN setup, where the model can benefit from the extra detail without the same classification constraints.",

In calculating the Kullback-Liebler divergence, you would normally use summation to reduce the loss, then divide by the batch size.

    "selftext": "I was working with SAM2 and have been trying to figure out the best way to fine-tune it for my specific use case. A few considerations that I was hoping get some insights on:\n\n1. **Error Correction vs Generalization:** If I'm interested in fine-tuning the model to perform better on cases where it went wrong most on, can I retains its performance on the examples it was already doing well on. i.e. still maintaining (or even improving) its prior generalizability? Or should I have enough number of examples it was doing well already on to preserve that performance?\n2. **Which Components to Fine-Tune?** In terms of the model's architecture, I've seen different advice on whether to fine-tune just the **mask decoder**, the **prompt encoder**, or both. In your experience, is fine-tuning just the mask decoder enough to improve performance, or do you need to adjust the prompt encoder as well? Or maybe there's more to it—like the backbone or other parts of the model? Is it computationally too much of a difference? Or are there other downsides/considerations as well?\n3. **Real-World Experiences:** For those who have fine-tuned SAM before, how has your experience been? Any tips, tricks, or pitfalls I should watch out for? Also, how did you go about preparing your fine-tuning dataset? Any suggestions on balancing the diversity of data vs focusing on edge cases?",

Deep learning and ml requires a lot of math which means you need to go to a university to get it. \n\nIn truth, you COULD learn everything in AI and ML through a combo of youtube videos and tutorials. It would probably be a lot slower and more inefficient to do it this way, but certainly feasible and a lot less expensive. \n\nBut that's not the problem. To actually make money in ML, you either need to find a job which will be very hard with no degree whatsoever or you need to start a company and frankly, AI/ML is usually only a component of a larger tech stack with very high labor costs needed to get the company going. This isn't like starting a restaurant or a laundromat by comparison\n\nPersonally, if all you are after is money, I'd argue it's better to be a standard software engineer.

Videos dont show the dynamic behaviour of Attention.\n\nAttention calculation looks different in Transformer when it is running. This is due to KV caching, RoPE embeddings, pre-fill and inference stages, etc.\n\nI suggest to:\n1) make new virtual environment\n2) install transformers from huggingface\n3) get running some small transformer (on cpu/gpu, doesnt matter)\n4) go to transformers.models.llama.modelling_llama\nand find LlamaAttention class\n5) log \"atten_weights\" (line 376) tensor into file when you run the model for very short context (e.g. 10 tokens ~ \"How are you doing today?\")\n6) plot the tensor for single head (batch, head, sequence, sequence), that is, the (sequence, sequence) matrix\n\nFurthermore, visualize computational graph for LlamaDecoderLayer from transformers.models.llama.modelling_llama.\n\n\nFor more info send me private message.",
        "Yes! Attention Mechanism is a key key aspect lol\n\nAsk ChatGPT to break it down to you.",
        "Attention was originally developed for RNNs (additive: Bahdanau; 2014, multiplicative: Luong; 2015). To understand the motivation behind it, you need to be familiar with the shortcomings of previous seq-to-seq models, namely, the information loss resulting from squashing all encoder states into one representation. \n\nTransformers isolate dot-product self-attention (indeed, that's why \"attention is all you need\" - the part you no longer need is the RNN). If you understand the softmax(QK\\^T)V part, then all the transformer is doing is adding different components around it (multi-head, layerNorm etc). There are some technical parts to understand if you want to understand the entire mechanism (masking, positional encoding, inference, encoder only, decoder only), but at the core is the self-attention mechanism.",
        "Avoid the original attention paper and look for the videos which run through GPT, karparthy etc. But basically what it is is a mini neural network that gates itself with itself,  and poses the question of what would this neural network learn if a learning signal is backpropogated from a missing word cloze tasks.",
        "As others have mentioned, check out Andrej Karpathy's YouTube channel, where he goes through building a transformer from scratch. You should also have some basic understanding of why LSTMs and GRUs (recurrent NN) are poor for long context lengths. This builds the basis behind why attention mechanism is so useful (i.e., by giving it the ability to attend to every token in its input context). \n\nIf you really want to build a broader base, you can check out Andrew Ng's deep learning specialization.  Course 5 goes into sequence models.",

Tensorrt runtime then takes this graph and generates it's own tensortrt execution graph that performs kernel fusion depending on the placement of Q/DQ nodes and the operations supported by tensortrt.

One alternative is to use C/C++ APIs, or maybe use ort in Rust which seems to support bfloat16 (https://docs.rs/ort/latest/ort/#feature-comparison)\n\nBfloat16 is an innovation linked to hardware acceleration.

While they’ve performed reasonably well, I’ve found them to be **quite slow**, even when running on high-performance hardware.\n\nThe one standout in terms of speed has been **Piper**. It’s incredibly fast, producing results even without using a GPU, and delivers **great quality in English**. However, there’s one significant downside: when I tested it in other languages (e.g., Italian), the output felt far less natural, with a noticeable English accent creeping in.\n\n# My Questions:\n\n1. Are there additional voices available for Piper that could improve non-English output?\n2. Is there a way to create **new, high-quality voices** for Piper? If so, what tools, datasets, or workflows would you recommend?\n3. Lastly, is there **anything comparable to Piper** in terms of speed but with broader or more natural multilingual support?",

    "title": "Do Transformers Really Need Residual Connections?",
    "selftext": "I’m curious about the necessity of residual connections in Transformer architecture. A standard Transformer Decoder-Only block typically consists of the following components:\n\n* Multihead Attention\n* Add residual connection\n* Layer Normalization\n* Dense layer\n* ReLU\n* Dense layer\n* Add residual connection\n* Layer Normalization\n\nThe common belief is that residual connections are necessary to prevent vanishing gradients. Without them, a significant portion of the training signal would get lost during backpropagation. However, I want to understand how residual connections actually influence the performance of a Transformer block, so I conducted a small experiment.\n\nI tested a Transformer Decoder-only model, similar to GPT. I started with a small model that included one residual block and trained it twice with the same initial weights: first with residual connections, then without them. Interestingly, I found no significant difference in training loss; there was neither faster convergence nor better performance with the residual connections.\n\nNext, I scaled up to a larger model, training it on a portion of the book Alice in Wonderland, where each letter was treated as a token. Here are the dataset settings I used:\n\n* Dictionary Size: 27 (only lowercase letters and space)\n* Number of Samples: 100\n* Sentence Length: 256\n\nModel Configuration:\n\n* Embedding Size: 128\n* Number of Heads: 4\n* Feedforward Dimension: 512\n* Number of Transformer Blocks: 16\n\nOnce again, I observed no significant improvement in Transformer block performance with residual connections. In some cases, the model without residuals even demonstrated better efficiency.\n\nMy question is: Under what conditions can we expect to see significant performance benefits from using residual connections in Transformer models?",

Whereas in my case I don't have any differential equations, but I do have some properties like, some of the equations depend only on some variables and there is a pattern.   \nI have tried to solve this problem using PSO ( particle swarm optimization) and it worked for N=2 but when scaled to N=4, I cannot get the result.  In my case I need to solve at least N=32 for it to be useful. \n\nIf anyone can help me point out to a tutorial or a paper which discusses something of this sort, it need not be only using neural networks, I want to solve them in anyway possible. \n\n  \nThank you.

        "dude it sounds like ur off to a good start with the triplet loss and resnet50 setup! honestly, to get better convergence, it might help to shake up the triplet selection a bit. instead of semi-hard triplets, go for batch-hard ones: grab the hardest positive and hardest negative (closest) for each anchor in the batch. it forces the model to learn the most useful features, which should help a ton with tricky stuff like sunglasses. another thing—maybe throw in more identities per batch, like 32, with 8 images each, keeping it half natural and half with sunglasses so also, tweaking the margin in the triplet loss could be gooder. a larger margin pushes positives and negatives farther apart and gives a clearer embedding space. if u set up up a learning rate scheduler could also keep the model from overshooting as it gets close to convergence. and yeah, keep an eye on ur augmentations! make those sunglasses look legit, and switch up the other augmentations so the model doesn’t get stuck on one type of noise or flip. checking validation accuracy and embedding visualizations like t-sne can help spot issues early. little changes like this should make the embeddings clearer and help ur model ace face verification, even with sunglasses!",

In regard to the weights, if you want them to be discrete as well, just change their types from float/double to int (I don’t really see a reason to do that but i guess you have some use case for it). In the end, it’s important to understand whether the target function should be discrete or the entire network (or part of it). If it’s the target function then you can always use classical classification functions (like Softmax) on the output or use a regression function and take the lower/upper value of the output, and you’ll get a discrete value. If needed you can always clamp it to the desired range. PyTorch gives you the flexibilities I mentioned.",

It's continuous as opposed to discrete.\n\nA non-continuous output variable would be a category, like cats vs dogs. Neural networks handle this fine by outputting 1 for cats, and 0 for dogs. And it uses an activation layer such as sigmoid to force the output value to be very close to 1 or 0.",
        "\"Mixture of experts\" is a general paradigm for addressing such problems. Essentially, you have a NN with n different output variables, and some additional mechanism which selects one of the output variables to actually output. This can give rise to discontinuity at the switching boundaries between different outputs.   \n  \nWhether it will be successful in your specific case is hard to say in advance though, as MoE introduces additional complexity in training, hyperparameter selection, etc. I'd try to look for existing research as a starting point. Probably lots of domains also have their own synonym for MoE which you'll have to find. Maybe chatgpt will help you do that :)",
        "I think for NeRF, the abruptness may be dealt with by the positional encodings (especially the higher frequency terms). \n\nAs for why it’s not a piecewise function in the first place, probably cuz the voxel grid is a discrete grid and not a proper continuous space? So straight up discrete/piecewise functions may cause jagged edges unless we smoothen them out when compositing the samples of the ray march when rendering the scene, but that again is similar to not even using piecewise functions is the first place right?",
        "Neural networks are indeed continuous functions, and often we think of them as parameterized functions that approximate some function in a smooth functional space such as Sobolev spaces. \n\nHowever in practice, it doesn't really matter that much. This is mainly because our data is limited by finite precision, so a smooth approximation can still appear \"discontinuous\" when you evaluate it on the support of the data.\n\nA simple way to illustrate this idea, is to train a model where let's say Y has a discontinuous jump at x=5. If you were to then generate a grid of very small values of x around 5, then the predictions form a smooth approximation to this discontinuous function. In practice however, we only observe something like 4.99, 5.01, so the model's predictions can still appear \"discontinuous\" with sufficient training data.\n\n(Also I don't really understand what the other commenters are trying to say. There seems to be some discussion of gradients, backpropagation, etc but these are applied to the neural network's weights, not the input. More precisely, we should think of it as f(x; W) ~ g(x) in L^2 for example, where f may or may not be differentiable w.r.t. W but that's different from x.)",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI've trained a yolov7-w6 on a custom datased using the previous checkpoint model that has pretrain is yolov7-w6\\_training.pt weights. The models showed noise results, so I decided to try to start a fresh train using the weights of one of the checkpoints. My new target is predict 4 class: card/bus/truck/bike, but the previous ckpt I load is trained for predict 5 class: bike/car/bus/truck/motorbike.  \nHere's the procedure I've followed: I created a new folder, cloned the git project, copied the dataset (deleting the labels.cache files), copied the checkpoint (in my case \"epoch\\_19.pt\") and started a fresh new train using the weights of the checkpoint, leaving the hyperparameters untouched.  \nThat's where the issues started. The epoch counter starts at 20 instead of 0 (keep in mind that the checkpoint is from epoch 19) even if the \"resume\" paramether is set to False and, more importantly, it doesn't save any \"best.pt\" checkpoint nor any \"last.pt\" one besides the first.  \nI'm using the latest version of the codebase and I've alredy checked that I have enough disk space. Did I do something wrong?\n\nThanks for your time from a desperate thesis student with a very close deadline.",

I have some older references (4-6 yrs old) from O'reilly/Manning/Packt on NLP, but I am not sure if they'd still be relevant. Comment if I can use these. \n\n  \n2. Can someone also demistify if I should continue learning to build stuff using Pytorch and transformers lib (which I believe is the richer format for learning) or should I learn FastAI. I really am not looking forward to rapid prototyping atm but everyone tells me its relevant. \n\n3.  How did you teach yourself to build NLP projects? Any insights into the process are welcome. How does one build project today - is it all about pre-trained models? what's the better thought process?\n\n  \nBackground - I understand theoretical concepts around NLP (and deep learning in general) but I am not well versed with the recent developments after the transformers. I am also comfortable writing code with Pytorch. Looking forward to build basic to advanced projects around NLP in a systematic and an organized learning format in order to develop skill. \n\nApologies in advance if I have asked too much in a single post.

    "title": "Handling Missing Features in Production for Regression Neural Net",
    "selftext": "I'm working on a regression problem to predict prices in the day-ahead energy market. I’ve trained a simple multi-layer perceptron (MLP) that takes a feature vector of length 20 as input and outputs a predicted price. However, in production, I anticipate that two specific features (out of the 20) may sometimes be missing. The missing features are known and constant—they are the only features that might be absent, while the rest will always be available.\n\nTo make predictions, I still need to provide all 20 features to the neural network. I understand that I could replace the missing values with the mean of these features, but I’m looking for a more sophisticated solution.\n\nWould it be possible to train a separate neural network—perhaps an autoencoder—that takes my feature vector and reconstructs it, so that when those two features are missing in production, the autoencoder can approximate them? If so:\n\n1. Should I introduce noise in the feature vector while training the autoencoder, or should I train it as is? My training and test datasets contain no missing features, but in production, those two features could be absent.\n2. Should the autoencoder be trained on the entire feature vector (all 20 features) or only the two potentially missing ones?\n\nAny advice on the best approach to use an autoencoder to handle these missing features would be greatly appreciated.

Any advice would be really helpful.\n\nHere is a problem statement. Your job is to analyse multiple smartphones, to determine which one to buy. You have been given, for each smartphone, a list of their details and specs. These details tell about the configuration & features of each smartphone. The details are only in textual sentences. This sentences can be for example the RAM, the screen size, the processor configuration, the launch date, the increasing popularity etc. Now say for each smartphone you have a 100 such details and you have a hundred smartphones in total to compare. The thing to note is that the type of details may not be common for all the smartphones. For example some smartphones may have folding feature which you can compare but some smartphones may not have folding feature at all. Your job is to create a program using LLMs and AI to analyse these details and compare the smartphones to determine which one is the best Smartphone to buy. You do not have any other kind of structure data about this items and you only have to use the LLMs to compare the smartphones.\n\nExplain only the approach you would use.\n\nThnxxxx",

Then the tricky part would be to somehow assign scores to each category.  Probably use semantic similarity to aggregate them under certain categories and then get the agents to have a conversation to decide what overall score to assign to each phone in each category.  You would need to maybe have tags like “subjective” and “objective”, categories such as “utility”, “design feature”, “innovative,” “kudos factor”, “physical characteristics”, “cost” relationship/descriptors and then weight those.  So then you’d aggregate the score probably with a query over the kg to collect the relevant data and then maybe a mixture of prompt and function call to assign an overall score that’s normalised in the identified categories?\n\nWhich to buy adds another layer of complexity as you need to do some kind of matching of requirement vs phone.  Again you can use kg and see how much overlap there is for all the phones getting a score.\n\nNot deep learning tho, unless you trained a model to predict customer satisfaction from requirement vs phone description.

    "selftext": "I spent a long time trying to figure out why gradient descent doesn't work correctly for me. Explain how it works. What's the difference between regular gradient descent and batch gradient descent. Average error for gradient descent (and I'm not talking about loss functions, but about backpropagation), how is it calculated? In the loss function, we kind of take this error squared, thereby amplifying it or taking the absolute one, but we don't divide it like that for backpropagation, thus the errors + - give 0. I have a neural network like this now: 4 input, 2 hidden, 1 output layer. I don't know how gradient descent works, but I'll assume for each how it works (I don't understand this, as I understand, and I want to express this idea so that you can correct me in the right direction). For example, a regular gradient descent calculates an error for the entire dataset, I don't know there, here is an example of datasets (0, 1, 1, 0) (1,0,1,0) (1, 1, 1, 0), and on the first dataset I expect the value 0, the second, 1, the third 1. When running with randomly initialized weights, LET'S say I get the following: 0.6, 0.3, 0.8. Here, for the loss function, I calculate like this: (0 - 0.6) \\^ 2 + (1-0.3) \\^ 2 + (1-0.8) \\^ 2. Everything will be okay here, the error is normal. Here is its sum and we divide it by the number of samples: 0.89 / 3 and that's how the loss is calculated. But for backpropagations it needs to be different: -2\\*(0-0.6) + -2\\*(1-0.3) + -2\\*(1-0.8), and here everything is different: The sum and its division: the sum is -0.6 and we divide it by 3, it turns out -0.2, we sort of go to correct, but the error will be the same, since we will get an average of -0.2 from the run of this era and we will go along the same path.",

But during training you can process the sequence at once by calculating the attention between each input token but allow tokens only to attend to all previous tokens relative to their position. This is achieved by multiplying the attention score of those tokens by a very small number before applying the softmax.",
        "Few statements:\n\n- Af inference, it is working in serially (it’s actually a serial quadratic algorithm in context length at inference).\n\n- During training and inference, it needs to process each layer in serial, layer after layer. This is standard.\n\n- During training within each layer, the attention matrix can be computed in parallel. Think of the attention matrix as a square matrix of shape context-length X context length. Each row of this can be computed in parallel with each other row. So it’s a quadratic algorithm in context length but fully parallelizable.",
        "The parallelization occurs within the attention head and the handling of Query Key and Value vectors. The affinity mapping (attention weight matrix) is computed simultaneously for each token in the input sequence. By finding the dot product of query_i with key_0-> key_n, the model computes the affinity for how strongly each token in the input sequence has towards the {i}th token.  I think there is an emphasis on “parallelism” about the transformer head because there’s no reliance on a previous element of the sequence to compute the current state (like a network with recurrent properties). The I’m not totally sure how the hardware computes this affinity mapping in parallel on the GPU but I know it is in parallel. \n\nLet me know if this is helpful!",

For big LLMs, heavy fine-tuning, or anything super GPU-intensive, a dedicated PC could pay off in the long run.  personally i love my PC it's opened a million doors",

After initial exploration you will know what you want to build and LLM size you'd like to run locally.\n\nIf you decide to build a PC consider possible upgrades to dual GPUs (not many MBs provides x8/x8 pcie lanes split, PSU should be around 1500W, big case so you can fit 2 GPUs and provide good airflow).\n\nConsider mac with plenty of unified RAM if you mainly interested in developing AI application (no training or fine-tuning)",

You can't train much with local, you probably need 6-9 months to break even on a used 3090, let alone a new card or a whole rig, and by that time you will no longer probably be able to fine tune relevant LLMs.\n\nMeanwhile with cloud, you can basically train anything you want. You just choose a GPU you need for the workload, do stuff with it, save your weights and stop using and paying for it.\n\nThe only reason to go local is if you need data confidentiality, which most people don't need, and the cloud providers are probably trustworthy enough to keep your data confidential.",

So you're stuck running it with the CPU, rather than the GPU.

I can only dream of training them, let alone an actual LLM. And even if everything was implemented, I would still be bottlenecked with the extremely slow bandwidth in a workload where even 2TB/s is too slow of a memory bandwidth, let alone the 100-500 GB/s the M chips have.",

The M4 Max runs north of 500 GB/s so half the BW of a RTX 4090. \n\nI suggested an M series macbook for development and testing and then using the cloud for scaling up your training job or getting faster inference. \n\nIt's nice to be able to do work while not connected to the internet and run locally during development",

Even the M1 Max is $1800!\n\n\nYou don't need much more than a modern laptop with a CPU and 16 GB of RAM for that, which machines from $550 or so will satisfact. And the cheapest new M mac you can buy with 16 GB of RAM is $1000, almost double that.\n\n\nFor what? A platform you will be running in CPU mode because MPS is heavily unfinished, especially for new models? A platform that you have to specifically develop and that you can't use elsewhere because it's a walled garden?\n\n\nAnd even still, you can use literally any free cloud alternative, like Google Cloud, which were made for this, even on a $200 Chromebook, and do the same thing. You don't need any kind of performance before you actually lock down what you're going to train. And once you do know that, you sure as hell aren't doing it on a Mac or a local device."

    "selftext": "Essentially, I have a trained model (using PyTorch) that I want to deploy on an edge device (all written in C/C++) for inference. Just for context (I'm working alone on this project so I don't get much guidance). My understanding is that, at deployment, the input (inference data needs to be integers), and my model's parameters (weights and bias/activation) also need to be integers. Because I don't have \"inference data\", I am currently testing out my implementation/prototyping by quantizing my validation/test data and comparing the validation/test results I get using the floating point model parameters vs the results I get using quantized/integer model parameters. To make this more concrete (or succinct), I'm testing with two cases:\n\n* Case 1: floating point model called on floating point train and test data.\n* Case 2: quantized int model parameters called on quantized test data. \n\n&#8203;\n\n                def quantize_tensor(tensor, num_bits): \n                    qmin = -

    "selftext": "Hi everyone! I'm working on an AI project that involves several models, and I’m exploring the best cloud service to use for GPU-based model inference. My requirements are as follows:\n\n* **Models:** I need to deploy text-to-speech, speech-to-text, text-to-image and a large language model (LLM).\n* **Performance:** I'm looking for high inference speed and minimal latency, as this will be a real-time or near-real-time application.\n* **Scalability:** I’d like a solution that can handle scaling with multiple users, ideally without cold starts.\n* **Cost Efficiency:** Budget is a consideration as I am thinking of bootstrapping, so I'd appreciate any insights into cost-effective services.\n\nI've looked into a few options like AWS, [vast.ai](http://vast.ai), runpod, and some specialized providers, but I’m unsure which would work best for this setup. Has anyone here worked with these or other services for similar needs? Any feedback on cost, performance, or ease of setup would be great!\n\nI have used runpod for text to image (SD-xl template) but inference is very slow.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\n\n**Edit**: I dont have idea about traffic my product woukd receive and cost is an issue, so using serverless compute would be great for me but Serverless gpu have cold starts and it cant be ignored. For starting phase, I think it would be appropriate to use inference api's like fal.ai, together, anyscale, etc. So it would be great if anyone can share their experience about using inference apis and self hosted gpus. Which would be optimal for unpredicted traffic. I guess it would be low for now.",

How do you intend on *confirming* whether it’s actually doing what it’s supposed to be doing?\n\nNow, you could also run into these problems if you grabbed some random code or tool online to do these things. But we’re talking a very simple parser/packages where documentation exists and where the source code is human readable.\n\nPresumably if you’re doing data manipulation on a CSV, and you’re doing deep learning stuff, why wouldn’t you just use Pandas?

I haven't tried this exact setup, but mixing 16kHz and 8kHz datasets has worked well for me. (the 8kHz is up sampled to 16kHz). Yes I know I'm not gaining new information by doing this, but at least the model can now handle both 8k and 16k audio, and the performance is slightly better when the original sampling rate is >16k.\n\nYou can try something similar. Interpret the 16bit audio as if it is 32bit. When the original resolution is 32bit, the performance should be slightly better.",
        "I do understand that, but what I meant is that my model was pretrained only with Audios of 32bit. Now i want to finetune but i only have 16 bit. I believe that this has an impact on the model. Spectrograms of 32 bit are different to 16 bit",
        "Ahhhh, then there is nothing you can do.\n\n\nIf you naively convert your audio to 32-bit, you don't get more information, your features and statistics remain basically the same. You can try to upscale it with AI, but most of the variance you are missing with 16-bit audio will be added as noise. I would probably just run it as-is.\n\n\nYou might even get better results. But do explore the preprocessing and how the audio is turned into features, as it might yield vastly different results for 16-bit.\n\n\nEDIT: Another idea, if you find the dataset that was used to pretrain the model, you could try finetuning it for an epoch or 2 on 16-bit versions of the audio. Then when you finetune on your 16-bit data there will be less discrepancies."

The idea is pretty straightforward: just ask your data questions and get instant answers.

If you’re interested, I’ve got a demo that shows it in action.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1gfjp5t/video/7al4qj0ojvxd1/player\n\nWould love to hear if anyone’s working on similar projects or has tackled similar challenges with NLP for data insights!",

    "title": "GitHub - Shindig: Convolutional Neural Network Implemented in C++",
    "selftext": "# Shindig\n Author: Lewis F.\n\nIntroduction to the Project:\nThis project is an implementation of inference and training for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on C++, without referencing other existing implementations. It is primarily divided into the following parts:\n\nInteractive Interface\n1 The interactive interface is implemented using Qt and includes:\n\t1.1 Parsing Training and Testing Sets\n\t1.2 Constructing Neural Network Structures\n\t1.3 Visualizing Loss Changes During Training\n\t1.4 Saving and Loading Existing Models\nThese functionalities are mainly implemented in FNN.cpp and its header files. In the future, the development of the interface will focus primarily on the presentation of the training process.\n\n2 Model Construction\nThis part is mainly responsible for constructing the structure of the convolutional network model and includes:\n\t2.1 Data Invocation\n\t2.2 Building Model Interfaces\n\t2.3 Invoking Model Inference Interfaces\n\t2.4 Invoking Training Interfaces\n\t2.5 Querying Model Information Interfaces\n\t2.6 Parsing Existing Model Interfaces\nThese functionalities are carried in CNNModel.cpp and its header files.\n\n3 Model Calculation\nThis part constructs the computational units of the neural network model on a per-layer basis, including convolutional layers and fully connected layers. Each layer consists of input processing, convolution, activation, pooling, and output processing. The computational units are highly modular and can be constructed sequentially. These functionalities are carried in CNNCalc.cpp and its header files.\nThe above outlines the layered structure of the entire project. Regarding the implementation framework for inference and training of convolutional neural networks, there are three options:\nPart 1. Naive Basic Implementation\n\tThis implementation is not highly optimized and uses 8-byte full precision. The priority is to ensure the correctness of the results, serving as a benchmark for the SIMD and CUDA versions.\nPart 2. SIMD Instruction Set Version\n\tThis version aims for improved training speed compared to the basic implementation and includes the following methods:\n\t--> Using SSE, AVX, AVX2, etc., CPU extended instruction sets. AVX512 is not used. If your CPU is powerful enough and has a large cache line, you can use instructions with higher parallelism.\n\t--> Parallel computation for each layer during training. Note that this parallelization may be counterproductive for extremely small models due to the overhead of creating and destroying CPU threads. However, if some layers have significantly more computation than the thread creation cost, efficiency can be significantly improved.\n\t--> Using single-precision for inputs, weights, and outputs.\n\nPart 3. CUDA Implementation\nCurrently, the CUDA implementation only covers inference. The training part is under development.\n\nAll the code was completed in its first version in August 2024 and was authored by a single individual. This version is named: FNN5-simd 1.5 - multiThread 2. It is important to note that, due to the code being completed by one person in a relatively short period, errors are inevitable. Any use of this project requires careful attention. In the near future, the author may continue to focus on improving the CUDA version rather than fixing bugs.\n\nIntroduction to the Author:\nthe Author currently works for a medical instruments company, developing various types of algorithms. His responsibilities include:\n1 Evaluating Business Requirements and Outputting Algorithm Solutions:\n2 Leading algorithm development, parameter establishment, and model deployment.\n3 Building Algorithm Development Platforms:\n3.1 Data Construction and Database Setup\n3.2 Neural Network Training Platform Setup:\n\tOptimized CPU computation using SIMD instruction sets.\n\tGPU implementation based on CUDA.\n\tDesign and deployment of model text and binary structures.\n3.3 Development and Optimization of Traditional Numerical Algorithms:\n\tVarious iterative fitting algorithms.\n\tSignal Kalman fusion.\n\tAlgorithms based on specific mathematical models.\n3.4 Multi-threaded Platform for Parallel Computation of Millions of Data Points\n3.5 Software Development to Support the Above Functionalities\n\nOther Responsibilities:\n\tFormulating the architecture of product algorithms.\n\tEstablishing technical standards for algorithm development.\n\tDefining the algorithm development process.\n\n",

        "Yes, you can do that. However, it is likely to give you a worst performance than simply adding a head (could be a linear layer or MLP) to the image model backbone.\nAdding a head would mean that you can backpropagate through the whole network and learn directly, allowing you to adjust the weights of your backbone.\nIf you just use a pretrained backbone with XGBoost, you won't be able to fine tune the backbone weights. Might work fine if the distribution of the pretraining data is the same as your dataset, but I would guess that you would be better off adding either a linear layer or an MLP."

    "title": "VQA model on GI images",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone! For my Master Thesis i'm currently working on Visual Question Answering, specifically about Gastro Intestinal images, and i have gathered some unanswered questions, mainly due to dataset and general deep learning practices, hope you can help me with those.\n\nThe doubts are the follwing:\n\n- Feature extractor: traditionally VQA models work on K features extracted from images, but in the dataset i am using only 1 feature is usually present per image (25~ total classes). So is it okay to classify the whole image (resized to 224) instead of extracting the interested portion with a detector first? Some classes need the whole image to do so, but generally speaking i have always seen detection + classification chained for the task\n- question encoding: for the general model (a bland classifier, in the end), i need to fuse the features extracted and the question embeddings, for which i am using a BERT model from HuggingFace. But how do i recognize if the model is really suitable for the questions i am encoding? Said questions are about gastro intestinal disease and abnormalities, e.g. \"are there abnormalities in the image? How many polyps are there?\", so i was thinking that perhaps i should just check if there are some unknown words that could be initialized or added to the model vocabulary?\n- multimodal fusion: traditionally speaking, again, the output of the feature extractor and embeddings are passed through non linear functions, hadamard product is computed and then the result pass through a linear layer/softmax for classification. I found an implementation online that torch.cat() the 2048 dim vector from feature extractor and the 768 dim word embedding (after performing a slice on the 14x768 output of the BERT model), then passes the tensor through a ReLU layer and then through a Linear layer. Are they both correct? Only one is? Does anyone have tips on what would be best generally speaking for such a model? I ask that due to the huge amount of time that an epoch needs (3h) and i am a bit anxious about wasting time, i know this is \"wrong\" but i feel like i am missing the point and really not understanding something right now.",

        "I don't have the hard data but I think 5x is way too much, let alone 10x. I'm personally even hesitant to double my dataset. Tbh at that point you're just \"polluting\" the dataset imo.\n\nAlso, to my knowledge so far augmentation is usually done on the fly so it doesn't necessarily add on extra images to the dataset. It just applies the augmentations to a portion of your already existing dataset.\n\nIf you feel the need to increase your dataset by that many images, I think you're better off finding more dataset out there rather using artificial images for more robust model.",
        "you might want to experiment with it just to be sure. im currently training my model to classify different breeds of cats and i find that basically 4x my datasets (flipping 0 90 180 and 270 degrees) added 5% to my test accuracy. Adding more did not hurt my model but increase training time while so i stick with 4x. Adding less only increase my test acc by 2.5%. I think in this field you should be patient and try out different things. There are so many things that should work in theory but i tried them and they either didn't work or ended up hurting my model",
        "If the augmentation function is chosen well, it doesn't hurt to use differently augmented data for each item or mini batch. This is what the Fast AI library does by default. You can increase the number infinitely, up to your training limit. It reduces the likelihood of over fitting and makes the model more flexible / less brittle. Of course it's not a substitute for getting more data.\n\nFor example, when a human learns what a flower is, we never see exactly the same image twice, but we might usefully see the same flower from different angles and at different scales, at different times of day or under different lighting, etc. Seeing a whole new flower is useful in a different way.\n\nI'm not exactly an expert in deep learning, this is just what I learned based mainly on the Fast AI book and courses. I'm sure other people have other ideas on it.",
        "Personally, I prefer to write a data generator which will do live augmentation. Because this is live, I try to limit to very simple operations, such as reversing, rot90, and flipping/transposing axes. Basically avoid anything which involves computing new pixel values.",
        "What's the point?\n\nIt's like trying to increase the number just for the sake of it. When people say you need a lot of data for training, they're talking about diverse data. Not the same data flipped and augmented. That's not informative. It's also the whole reason active learning exists. To remove data that is not informative from a large pool of unlabeled data.",
        "I like to use augmentations but I would only 3-5x more than that it’s best to get more real world images. ",
        "If post your augmentation, the distribution of data set is same then it doesnt matter as post that the learning will be pretty good with it depending on the model you choose but while testing you can check your model to see if the variance got high or not by making the test set also large enough. Also you can do it in a manner that- make the test test in same distribution as the train set in scenario one and then in scenario 2 make the distribution of test set unbalanced and then try to test the model for its performance",
        "Seconding all the other points of erring towards finding another dataset. Augmentations generally don't extend the distribution you're learning so much. It's a little more useful in cases where the dataset is already quite sizeable but maybe each individual sample within the dataset is very \"far\" from each other in the feature space. In that case, augmentation is useful for generating a few extra points around each of the points to close the gap between the points in the dataset and smoothen out the learned manifold. As such, it's quite good for regularization.",
        "You'll be fine as long as the augmentations are significant enough.  Just keep an eye on the validation and test results to make sure it's not overfitting.",
        "It depends on the augmentations and what you're training for.",
        "Simple answer is no as there are a lot of reasons\n1. You have to maintain that data in the long run. So if you have 150,000 images you are making 10 times, a big no. No one will give you that much resources.\n2. You have to know exactly what scenarios it failed, eg in blurry images you are seeing many times it's failing. Go ahead but due to reason 1 we do while training. Since you have a simple cnn, you can do the experiment.\n3. In my experience I have seen adding noise in images did not gave significant improvements. Yes 85 percent to 87 percent. If you believe that's good enough reason, go ahead and try.\n\n\nNow coming to your usecase. You can try different datasets and see if it is really helping. You can experiment and see what is working and what is not.\nAlos, it might result in drop in accuracy as well because you might end up changing the distribution of the training dataset and now your validation set is not representative of the training set.",
        "First of all, u need to check if your image is clean, and correct. Then do 2x , if the result ok, then increase it",
        "You’re not extending the distribution of data by augmentation. I spent a long time trying to find a shortcut to labelling images - in the end it’s faster to just label more data.",
        "Hi! I would suggest to randomly darken/spot some pixels. When your dataset increases, try to increase the model size as well.",
        "Was going to comment the same, write some script to augment data at scales 1.1-1.9, find a sweet point and us it.",
        "You let your validation determine whether or not you've \"polluted\" your dataset.  If he's doing image based he's probably using a CNN, the filters are small enough that even just flipping an image makes significant enough changes to it that the CNN won't be able to detect.",
        "This. This right here",
        "*So if you have 150,000 images*\n\n  \nIf you read the OP's initial message, they mention having 300 images (and probably that's why they desire a higher than usual ratio)",
        "I'm curious, what would the randomly darkening do? Why do you recommend that?",
        "Fair point but it's also highly dependent on the augmentations themselves. Simple geometric transforms should be ok in theory but if we're messing with noise and such, things might've different.",
        "Yes I answered that as well in the later section of my reply.",
        "It is method to \"adversary\" attack trained model with darkening some pixels. I don't know if some people don't know it. If the model will understand the context of the darkened spots it will generalize better, I think.",
        "Why would noise be different?  It's always been quite common in computer vision to add things like salt and pepper, gaussian blurring, or perlin noise to images.",
        "To each their own, agree to disagree and all that. I'm not gonna argue with you on who's \"more right\". All the info we know is OP trying to augment dataset and that's it, with which we fill in the gap from our experiences. I think my mistake was to speak too much on the absolutes side of things. Should've been more diplomatically provisional in my language.\n\nAlso I guess in a way that's the beauty of the black box tech we have here and all its possibilities. Sometimes we just never know.\n\nAll the best.",
        "You can know though...you just try with both of them and check the metrics.  It's pretty straight forward.  Also there is no agree to disagree.  I'm not even sure how you were under the impression that adding noise to images doesn't help the dataset.  It's literally one of the fundamental things to do in CV.  I'm certainly not a know it all, but if you want to talk basics, it seems like I can talk circles around you.",
        "You're very right, my bad. I hope that settles it for you.",
        "I just find it funny that you're acting like something that can be scientifically proven or disproven you're acting like it's an opinion piece.",
        "Just curious, is there a rule of thumb as to which augmentations are preferable?  Do some augmentations just not help that much?",
        "Depends on application, thus using logic required. Turning a 6 too much makes it a 9. Adding too much noise to a.forest picture makes it a lake with algea. If my aunt had a moustache, ... well it is probably a bad idea to classify close family anyways.\n\nEdit: Also depends on the model. Most models have some kinds of invariances to some transformations but not always the case for **all** transformations"

Should it go in a specific folder, or do I need to reference it in a particular way within the code?\n2. **Understanding exactly how the model works:** We understand the basic structure of how SAM-SLR works but we don't understand how the pretrained data is used and how the pretrained model .pt files are used to show the full extent of the SAM-SLR.\n3. **Image Preparation**: I have a 512x512 image that adheres to the AUTSL dataset requirements, but I need clarification on how to preprocess this image for input into the model. Are there specific preprocessing steps I need to follow before running the inference?\n4. **Running the Model**: I’m uncertain about the steps required to run the model itself. Are there particular scripts or commands I should execute to get the model up and running with my input image?\n5. **Testing Preprocessed Models**: Lastly, once I have the model running, what are the best practices for testing the preprocessed models? Any tips on evaluation metrics or expected outputs would be greatly appreciated.\n\nI am eager to learn and would be grateful for any guidance, insights, or resources you could share to help me move forward with this project.",

    "selftext": "One recently accepted EMNLP paper titled \"*Towards a Semantically-aware Surprisal Theory\"  (*Meister et al., 2024*)(*[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.17676](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.17676)*),*  in which the authors introduce the concept of similarity-adjusted surprisal. Although surprisal is a well-established concept, this paper presents a weighting algorithm, z(w<t,wt,w′), which adjusts surprisal based on the (semantic) similarity between wt and other words w′ in the vocabulary. This approach allows the model to account for both the probability of a word and its similarity to other contextually appropriate words.\n\nI would like to bring to your attention that the algorithm for similarity-based weighting was first proposed in my preprint series from last year (my work titled \"Optimizing Predictive Metrics for Human Reading Behavior\" [https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.03.556078v2](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.03.556078v2); [arXiv:2403.15822](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15822);  [arXiv:2403.18542](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18542)). In these preprints, I also detailed the integration of semantic similarity with surprisal to generate more effective metrics, including the methodology and theoretical foundation.  Additionally, I’d like to provide my other related research using such metrics. My earlier work on contextual semantic similarity for predicting English reading patterns was published in Psychonomic Bulletin & Review ([https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423-022-02240-8](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423-022-02240-8)). Recent work on predicting human reading across other languages will appear in Linguistics, Cognition. Moreover, more preprints expand on using these metrics in modeling human neural activity during language comprehension and visual processing:  \n  \n[https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2410.09921](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2410.09921)  \n[https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.14052](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.14052)  \n\n\nDespite clear overlap, the accepted paper (Meister et al., 2024) has not cited my work, and its primary contributions  and methods (including research objective) closely mirror my algorithms and ideas released earlier than this accepted paper.\n\nAdditionally, I observed that multiple papers on surprisal at major conferences (EMNLP) originate from the same research group. In contrast, my paper submission to EMNLP 2024 (based on [arXiv:2403.15822](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15822) and available at [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=M8x89u5ZsO#discussion)) received unusually low ratings, despite the originality of my approach involved with upgrading surprisal algorithms. These patterns raise concerns about potential biases in the panel of cognitive modeling research in EMNLP that may hinder the fair evaluation and acknowledgment of novel contributions.\n\nIn light of these overlaps and broader implications, I respectfully request a formal review of the aforementioned paper’s originality and citation practices, and I ask that the paper be withdrawn pending this review. EMNLP holds a strong reputation in NLP and computational linguistics,  plagiarism or breaches of academic ethics are not tolerated. ",

However, in your post, it appears that you went public with the accusations across multiple subreddits, without mentioning any efforts to follow these procedures.\n\nWhile I can’t comment on this specific case, consider the possibility of an unintentional overlap or re-discovery. Authors are generally expected to be familiar with relevant literature, but oversights can happen. If you had addressed your concerns privately and they had withdrawn the paper, the matter would have been resolved. Alternatively, if their approach varied substantially, adding a citation could have sufficed.

Some people also think reaching out to the authors' institution directly is appropriate as a last measure. However, if you’ve pursued all formal channels and still feel that your concerns about plagiarism were mishandled, going public may be warranted. At that point, though, the focus would be on bringing attention to the inadequacies in how your concerns were addressed, on top of the plagiarism issue itself.

Right now, we’re collaborating on several work-in-progress papers with the aim of full submissions to top conferences like CVPR and ICML.\n\nThat said, we have even more ideas we’re excited about. Still, a few of our main limitations have been access to proper guidance and funding for GPUs and APIs, which is crucial for experimenting and scaling some of our concepts. If you or your lab is interested in working together, we’d love to explore intersections in our fields of interest and any new ideas you might bring to the table!\n\nIf you have resources available or are interested in discussing potential collaborations, please feel free to reach out! Looking forward to connecting and building something impactful together!

    "title": "From Zero to High-Tech: Empowering Beginners to Embrace Self-Transformation in the Tech World",
    "selftext": "In everyone’s career, there are moments of confusion, setbacks, and transitions. My career path reflects a journey from being a novice to gradually finding my direction. By sharing my experiences, I hope to inspire and motivate those who are currently seeking growth in their professional lives.\n\n**1. Entering the Workforce: Transition from Foreign Trade to R&D**\n\nMy career started in foreign trade, a natural choice after graduation(Economic Management and Foreign Trade). This job exposed me to different cultures and business operations worldwide. By chance, I interviewed for a CEO assistant position at a European company and was selected. In this role, I served as the bridge between the CEO and the R&D department, coordinating and delivering R&D projects. Given my non-technical background, the challenges were immense, but I gained invaluable experience.\n\nTo better align with the R&D cooperation between the Chinese and European headquarters, the company brought in a new CTO, an experienced former Nokia manager, along with a European management team. I became the CTO’s assistant, and he became a critical mentor in my career. Not only did he make sure I read *China Daily* every day, but he also shared stories of his military service, providing a powerful example of discipline and long-term commitment.\n\nDuring this time, something shifted within me. I enrolled in a self-study undergraduate program, registered for the PMP exam, and even signed up for driving lessons. However, my savings couldn’t cover all these expenses at once, In order to ensure my basic living, I borrowed money from an engineer (I borrowed some almost every month, and paid back what I could afford the next month). I’m still grateful for his help, and we stay in touch — he’s around my father’s age and continues to be incredibly kind, even lending me money without certainty I could repay him.\n\nIn order to achieve the above goals, I changed my behavious from listening to music on my commute, I switched to listening to courses. I used to relax on weekends, but soon my weekends were filled with study sessions. Over time, I realized the importance of having hard skills in the tech field.\n\n**2. Setbacks and Reflections in a Fortune 500 Company**\n\nLater, I joined a Fortune 500 company specializing in electronic products, where I worked as an assistant to the international director. Given that employees like me — without prestigious degrees or overseas experience — were rare in the company, I treasured this hard-won opportunity. I gave my all, whether in daily tasks or during overtime, seeing every assignment as a chance to learn and improve.\n\nDespite silently enduring the pressure of heavy workloads, I eventually realized that people may assume you’re capable of bearing infinite pressure if you never express your limits. Additionally, my annual performance review didn’t meet my expectations. Colleagues in R&D, with their stronger technical backgrounds, were assigned more critical tasks, while my role seemed relatively ordinary.\n\nThis experience taught me an important lesson: while hard work is essential, expressing your needs and value is equally important. It’s crucial to ensure that the tasks you’re assigned are not easily replaceable.\n\n**3. The Second Turning Point: Entering the IT Field**\n\nI interviewed for an Associate Project Manager (APM) position at an Australian company with two interviewers, Deon and David. Due to technical issues, the interview was conducted over the phone. I was so nervous that I struggled to express myself clearly, and after 18 minutes, one of the interviewers cut me off and ended the interview. I was devastated, but I couldn’t resist adding, “Although I didn’t articulate well, I do understand the client’s pain points and know how to solve them.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/scbuujcs33xd1.png?width=1223&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a9b062e6f0894aa7cb3a2faf115a30b981707e3\n\nTo my surprise, the next day, the recruiter called me, saying, “The interviewers have decided to give you another chance because they saw your determination to address client pain points.” I was asked to respond to several questions in a Word document, keeping my answers concise and clear, and to create a three-page PowerPoint explaining my thought process. I was thrilled to get another shot and poured all my energy into it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ze5c9ket33xd1.png?width=1221&format=png&auto=webp&s=d57b846fc3884c5ad8bdd55a6b16c67981ccd3f5\n\nAfter submitting my work, the recruiter told me, “Deon said he doesn’t want you to read from the PPT during the second interview.” But when the interview began, I couldn’t help but present almost exactly what I had written in the PPT. Deon interrupted me, saying, “Yan, I asked you not to read from the PPT, but you didn’t follow that instruction.” I apologized and asked if I could have another chance to improve. He replied, “No, this was already your second chance.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ndhx4vlu33xd1.png?width=1229&format=png&auto=webp&s=c619d035edadb4b6246bc7dfae534673f82937ed\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wzcaw1uw33xd1.png?width=491&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca07b38e75bc965c414ec6faf2cb4e5f6d52ca68\n\n[This was the mess one I made to explain the word above, with only writing which was not the expectation of what they need.](https://preview.redd.it/7sy5vkhz33xd1.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc6baf64b1b4aca9a3cba302d991f2a67b766ce5)\n\nAfterward, I couldn’t stop reflecting on the experience. I messaged Deon on WhatsApp, saying, “I know I didn’t meet your expectations in either interview, but I would like to improve. Could I give it another try and show you a revised solution that aligns with your needs?” I then sent him a flowchart I had designed and asked if that was what he was looking for.\n\nTo my surprise, he responded, sharing his expectations for a solution. I stayed up all night to revise it, sending it to him the next day with a message, “Let me know if this meets your requirements.” The recruiter soon informed me that I had passed the interview and that I was now being offered a Senior Project Manager (SPM) position instead of APM. I was overjoyed!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/og2gmyw143xd1.png?width=1239&format=png&auto=webp&s=138b88648bd34aaf1543ac01aba568e1de1874ba\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5oxyz04343xd1.png?width=1219&format=png&auto=webp&s=538b835742d2bdf07e81f2ae7f456d46cf5a78bd\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o4j5vm1443xd1.png?width=734&format=png&auto=webp&s=abd04d79f8c9c44da57c3aec7a98b2753c583528\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hwk3iiv543xd1.png?width=733&format=png&auto=webp&s=2348a6a37f9550b575369eb471a45d9ffdbe9475\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a9gyxlx643xd1.png?width=763&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0905ae5176a7aa420f53d0d3aebba44695c6fb0\n\nAfter joining the company, I was responsible for providing solutions to a client in the logistics sector, including eliminating old systems, introducing new ones, and restructuring the group’s system architecture. The project, tailored for China, was complicated by the acquisition of the company by an Australian logistics firm, requiring coordination across multiple countries. Cultural differences, varying business practices, and concerns about job security made project management particularly challenging.\n\nAs a project manager without a technical background, I faced a lot of skepticism. Tech lead and some China-base stakeholders doubted my ability to manage an IT project. However, I remained positive, with the support and training provided by my boss, and used my spare time to study and obtain multiple IT certifications, including ITIL 4, AGILE, TOGAF, and CISP. Over time, I combined this theoretical knowledge with practical experience, gradually improving my professional abilities. After a year of hard work, the project was successfully delivered, earning praise from both the client and my boss.\n\nAfter the project ended, due to the lack of new projects, a large foreign bank offered me a position as an IT project manager. I discussed the opportunity with my boss Deon frankly, and Deon said: As a boss, I want you to stay and work together, but from a friend’s perspective, it is also a good choice for you to develop in the bank in the long run. Ultimately, I decided to embark on a new journey as an IT PM at the bank.\n\nWhile working at the bank, I continued to learn and practice various skills. I enjoyed working alongside developers, learning about and handling technical issues, which I found fascinating. I became increasingly interested in big data and AI, both of which were involved in some of the projects I worked on. Still, I felt that my technical knowledge was lacking.\n\nMeanwhile, KJ, a client from the logistics industry in Singapore, was impressed by my meticulous project management and offered me a permanent position as a delivery supervisor. The salary, benefits and position were much better than my position in the bank, and I already knew the team well. It happened that the internal situation of the bank was also undergoing severe changes at that time, so I accepted the offer. However, deep down, I was eager to continue pursuing my interest in big data and artificial intelligence, so I ended up turning down the offer and recommended a reliable former colleague to take up the position as soon as possible, so as not to affect the recruitment progress and personnel quality of the former client. I still feel guilty for turning it down but remain grateful for the opportunity.\n\nThen I continued working at the bank and enrolled in a two-year part time master’s program in Big Data and AI Management. An unexpected opportunity later arose, and I moved to Hong Kong to work as an Innovation Manager at a big bank. Yet, my desire to learn programming grew stronger, and I developed a five-year roadmap to pursue these goals. After completing the first year of my Big Data program, I enrolled in another online master’s program in Data Analytics in the U.S. To truly immerse myself in these fields, I took a break from work to focus on learning programming, technology, and AI.\n\nAlthough I started later than many others, I would regret not pursuing this dream. After completing my training, I will reflect on my future career and life choices, striving to align my work with my passions. Part of my five-year roadmap is complete, and the rest will be adjusted based on real-world conditions.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qz6f547843xd1.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4309a989890a301968ab1736f8d423908643043\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nkkkvv8943xd1.png?width=955&format=png&auto=webp&s=8293fd246d9fbcf3b550f0c50e503914b445e389\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ytontm6a43xd1.png?width=959&format=png&auto=webp&s=de842e952d84006d29ff06cb2d75ca1776c1d761\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\n\nThe journey is not easy and TRANSFORMATION is never easy — it’s like a crab shedding its shell or an eagle breaking its wings to be reborn. I hope my future life will be more meaningful and enjoyable.\n\nAdditionally, serving your clients well, whether internal or external, is crucial. During this period, I reconnected with a former client who offered me a six-month contract in the financial sector. It allows me to collaborate with roles such as Modelers and DevOps, which is closely related to my promotion of big data analysis and related fields. I look forward to adding value for my clients and myself.\n\nLearning never stops — start with words, move with actions, and the journey continues, and Enjoy life.\n\n[](https://medium.com/@yanlambg?source=post_page-----360a556c98df--------------------------------)",

        "Are you planning to use it as your daily computer too?\n\nI have built a few of these things (for some bizarre reason I still can't explain) - and have a lot of practical experience leveraging:\n\n1. A main local PC.\n2. Multiple old pc/laptops on an interna lan.\n\nWhile...\n\n3. Augmenting my already-powerful local GPU resources with cloud GPU... \n4. ... as well as external (treated more like internal via cloudflare) Hetzner and other accounts. \n\nI have a built one with the 7950x and 4090 (though it has two). Here's my experience regarding a pc like the one you mention:\n\n1. Most important: power supply.\n2. Motherboard. \n3. Video (cards).\n4. Case - in order to avoid insanity.\n\nIf it will also serve as your daily driver, then RAM goes up there right around 1, 2, 3. \n\nUnexpectedly (for me), I found that the motherboard the most potential to impact the configuration. RAM & video card impact sheer power, usability, etc. - but the motherboard - choosing the right one is really important. \n\nBut my answer - specifically - would depend on whether this was to be your daily driver or a server or similar.\n\np.s. The case also has the potential to cause heart ache.",
        "Long-term context generation woes echo concerns over LLMs' 'hall of mirrors' - a reflection of their own complexity!",
        "Thanks for the feedback! This would also be for daily use and general software development. Any recommendations on motherboards?",
        "Tell me more about the mobo selection and the server/pc distinction",
        "You're welcome. Based on what you've said I, personally, would upgrade the RAM. In fact for that 4090 build I did. I had 128 since that was the max I could get (I think due to mobo limitations). And when I saw that something had been updated (again, I don't recall what exactly) and I could now use these, I immediately bought them: CORSAIR VENGEANCE DDR5 RAM 192GB (4x48GB) 5200MHz CL38 Intel XMP iCUE Compatible Computer Memory - Black (CMK192GX5M4B5200C38).\n\nWhy? Because I have been hammering my main pc very hard and at the time was doing a ton of things with docker and containers and RAG, python, etc. - creating stuff using AI to do all sorts of things... I mean if I could think of it I just made it (I still do this, much more aggressively now since my own knowledge has improved a lot - and with things like Cline and Aider - which are insanely great). \n\nI did a lot of things with N8N, too, and similar AI-based low-code stuff, but realized I much preferred just coding in VSCode. So I then decided to dual-install linux (Kubuntu) and played around with that.\n\nI removed removed docker from win11 wsl2 and set it to run on another computer on my internal lan.\n\nOkay - the bottom line of all this: BECAUSE I AM USING IT AS MY DAILY DRIVER - even with a shit-ton of Ram I would find things 'bogging' and it was irritating. So I'm very happy - again because it's my daily driver, too - that I have a lot of RAM.\n\nMy setup is for what you're looking for as well AI, daily use, software development. \n\nRegarding the motherboard I don't know which one - but I can tell you this - people have motherboard expertise like others who have build a pc expertise. When I started down this path two years ago, I thought a motherboard was a motherboard - but it's not, particularly when you are talking about AI & LLMs - you have to pay a lot of attention to this like PIC channels, etc. \n\nI can help guide you here but hopefully someone smarter in this area will come along. I can tell you that my next build (why do I keep doing this to myself??!) - will be with this motherboard:\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1gcn3w9/a_glance_inside_the_tinybox_pro_8_x_rtx_4090/\n\nBut that's probabaly way overkill for you!\n\nHowever, the ideas that are discussed there are the same things you need to pay attention to - e.g. PCI channels. I don't know enough about that but it really impacts video card usage, but then again, maybe that's more if you have dual video cards.\n\nMobo just turned out to be more complex than I thought!",
        "Sure, some of this is copied from my reply to OP.\n\nFirst, the way I'm using server/pc is to distinguish between (1) will you be using the computer daily as your main pc/daily driver? whereas (2) server - is just any kind of computer that is running on its own and not trying to support your own personal/work needs.\n\nRegarding motherboards - this was the complicated part of the builds for me.\n\nRegarding the motherboard I don't know which one - but I can tell you this - people have motherboard expertise like others who have build a pc expertise.

I can tell you that my next build (why do I keep doing this to myself??!) - will be with this motherboard:\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1gcn3w9/a_glance_inside_the_tinybox_pro_8_x_rtx_4090/\n\nBut that's probably overkill for most people. \n\nHowever, the ideas that are discussed there are the same things you need to pay attention to - e.g. PCI channels. I don't know enough about that but it really impacts video card usage, but then again, maybe that's more if you have dual or more video cards.\n\nMobo just turned out to be more complex than I thought!"

    "title": "[D] Transformers-based LLMs will not become self-improving",
    "selftext": "**Credentials**: I was working on self-improving LLMs in a Big Tech lab.\n\nWe all see the brain as the ideal carrier and implementation of self-improving intelligence. Subsequently, AI is based entirely on models that attempt to capture certain (known) aspects of the brain's functions. \n\nModern Transformers-based LLMs replicate many aspects of the brain function, ranging from lower to higher levels of abstraction:\n\n(1) Basic neural model: all DNNs utilise neurons which mimic the brain architecture;\n\n(2) Hierarchical organisation: the brain processes data in a hierarchical manner. For example, the primary visual cortex can recognise basic features like lines and edges. Higher visual areas (V2, V3, V4, etc.) process complex features like shapes and motion, and eventually, we can do full object recognition. This behaviour is observed in LLMs where lower layers fit basic language syntax, and higher ones handle abstractions and concept interrelation. \n\n(3) Selective Focus / Dynamic Weighting: the brain can determine which stimuli are the most relevant at each moment and downweight the irrelevant ones. Have you ever needed to re-read the same paragraph in a book twice because you were distracted? This is the selective focus. Transformers do similar stuff with the attention mechanism, but the parallel here is less direct. The brain operates those mechanisms at a higher level of abstraction than Transformers.  \n\nTransformers don't implement many mechanisms known to enhance our cognition, particularly complex connectivity (neurons in the brain are connected in a complex 3D pattern with both short- and long-term connections, while DNNs have a much simpler layer-wise architecture with skip-layer connections). \n\nNevertheless, in terms of inference, Transformers come fairly close to mimicking the core features of the brain. More advanced connectivity and other nuances of the brain function could enhance them but are not critical to the ability to self-improve, often recognised as the key feature of true intelligence. \n\nThe key problem is plasticity. The brain can create new connections (\"synapses\") and dynamically modify the weights (\"synaptic strength\"). Meanwhile, the connectivity pattern is hard-coded in an LLM, and weights are only changed during the training phase. Granted, the LLMs can slightly change their architecture during the training phase (some weights can become zero'ed, which mimics long-term synaptic depression in the brain), but broadly this is what we have. \n\nMeanwhile, multiple mechanisms in the brain join \"inference\" and \"training\" so the brain can self-improve over time: Hebbian learning, spike-timing-dependent plasticity, LTP/LTD and many more. All those things are active research areas, with the number of citations on Hebbian learning papers in the ML field growing 2x from 2015 to 2023 (according to Dimensions AI). \n\nWe have scratched the surface with PPO, a reinforcement learning method created by OpenAI that enables the success of GPT3-era LLMs. It was ostensibly unstable (I've spent many hours adapting it to work even for smaller models). Afterwards, a few newer methods were proposed, particularly DPO by Anthropic, which is more stable. \n\nIn principle, we already have a self-learning model architecture: let the LLM chat with people, capture satisfaction/dissatisfaction with each answer and DPO the model after each interaction. DPO is usually stable enough not to kill the model in the process. \n\nNonetheless, it all still boils down to optimisation methods. Adam is cool, but the broader approach to optimisation which we have now (with separate training/inference) forbids real self-learning. So, while Transformers can, to an extent, mimic the brain during inference, we still are banging our heads against one of the core limitations of the DNN architecture. \n\nI believe we will start approaching AGI only after a paradigm shift in the approach to training. It is starting now, with more interest in free-energy models (2x citation) and other paradigmal revisions to the training philosophy. Whether cutting-edge model architectures like Transformers or SSMs will survive this shift remains an open question. One can be said for sure: the modern LLMs will not become AGI even with architectural improvements or better loss functions since the core caveat is in the basic DNN training/inference paradigm. ",

Not long after you upclick (say no more than 24 hours), a PEFT-like/process-supervision/RL training phase grinds through that chain-of-thought trace and stores the updates in your personal parameter space for your next use.  In this scenario, your model instance gets better with every task every day, just like human learning while only training a tiny subset of the entire model.  (And your AI cloud provider is also using your successes to improve the next base model.)\n\n  \nWhere does this approach run into a problem?  It seems it is pretty close to human learning, with short-term learning largely using experience and recent memory (inference, RAG, prompt-space), and long-term learning requiring something like sleep and memory consolidation (training update).",
        "LongGenBench got its 'kick' with Graph Attention, but can we use Explainable AI to kick Long Gen Degradation to the curb?",
        "The brain uses multiple types of stimulis for learning. A child has no knowledge of the word but learns to absorb and imbibe  from various stimulis like smell, sight, taste, sound. The only thing we have (if I ain't wrong) is something like CLIP, which attempts to bring text and images in the same dimensional space, so the question of intelligence is far off until we can build a model which feeds off all those stimulis for generating intelligence. Until then, we will just have to do with brute force statistical models.",
        "This feels very reliant on the current status of LLMs, especially assumptions about the models not getting additional training. You're essentially saying that transformers will never become continuously running agents--because if they did, they would actually become self improving in the same way that humans now improve AI (through training, architecture innovations, and scaling).\n\nCare to make any concrete predictions, like that we'll never have agents that can run for an entire day or something similar?",
        "No real talk allowed here. Onl hype!",
        "I believe I haven’t actually written this out enough, apologies for that. \n\nI agree that you can do continuous improvement with DPO. The issues I see here are:\n(1) in practice it’s very expensive and will become even more expensive. LeCun has one said that we need more multi-modality to get to AGI as text is too narrow of a window for an AI to study the world. This will lead to an explosion in dataset sizes. \n\nWith this, we’d need novel algorithms integrating inference and training. \n(2) Persistent training after each interaction would enable much faster progression compared to batch-based RL. \n(3) Ideally, we should move to dynamic plasticity so the model may rearrange its architecture slightly as it’s being trained (and during inference too). This would enable much faster progression compared to what we could achieve with a batch DPO loop. \n\nSo, you may absolutely be correct and AGI will be achieved despite those challenges with the current paradigm. Yet, I’m slightly skeptical (and here it’s an IMHO judgement) and I believe we’d first need to develop training or at least fine-tuning algorithms enabling some form of dynamic plasticity during training.",
        "He might be right, who knows. Certainly not claiming that LLM-driven AGI within the current paradigm is impossible, just IMHO unlikely and vastly suboptimal",
        "That’s an interesting take! HITL all the way!",
        "I appreciate your view! I still err on the side of neuroscientific interpretation of many DNN concepts and that’s what we used to do as a lab, but I appreciate it that there may be different viewpoints. I shouldn’t have been this confident with the opening statement.",
        "Concrete prediction: online RL from all feedback coming into a large enough model (Claude/GPT scale both in size and usage) will not be possible with SGD optimisation if the model ingests mostly multimodal data, regardless of the progress in compute.",
        "Agreed with (1). What is persistent training (2)? And why do you suggest we need dynamic architecture adjustment (3)? Is this like a similar argument to on-policy/off-policy loosely?\n\nI’m not suggesting AGI is achievable with current tools. I’m just not sure I fully understand or see your argument that it’s an architectural rather than a data or data generation limitation.",
        "LeCun is in the minority on the multimodality requirement AFAIK",
        "> in practice it’s very expensive\n\nthat means we have the technology",
        "I agree on your points but also humans are not data centric, a person doesn't need to analsyse thousands of hours of video feeds to drive a car. I have also been thinking about adaptable architectures and continual learning for a while and reading your posts made me realize I need to read about the brain more.",
        "(2) By persistent I mean updated model behaviour which stays beyond a single inference run. Apologies, kind of a self-created term born in arguments with people claiming that o1 has “achieved self-improvement” (even though it doesn’t stick beyond a single answer). \n\nThis would be helpful, since if the model kept updating itself after each step, it would complete tasks much faster and better, yielding more end-to-end positive examples on diverse problems. \n\n(3) I believe plasticity would be helpful to avoid the need to retrain as we come up with improvements to the core model architecture. If the model could auto-update its own connectivity pattern in a more complex way than shutting down / zero’ing weights during training, it could self-progress from (say) BERT to GPT-3 to o1 and beyond. Not a critical requirement, but often seen as a prerequisite for the AGI claim by some people I’ve spoken with.",
        "Well, to me it seems he’s right in principle, most models move into multimodality now. Also, the deaf and blind human argument is very convincing to me — attempt teach a deaf and blind human anything.",
        "Hmm interesting, thanks for clarifying. I think (2) would run into the same stability issues which RL has had to tackle, wouldn’t it? Not saying it’s insurmountable, but isn’t this fundamentally a data generation and exploration problem? If you retain the feedback for use in later RL updates, you’re essentially not losing much right?\n\nAgreed you can avoid these big retraining projects if we can do (3). But I am not sure if that’s actually limiting anything. Given the amount of money poured into this area, retraining seems like a clean and freeing modus operandi.",
        "Multimodality offers utility to consumers and isn't indicative of it being necessary for AGI.  The dead blind argument is poor for so many reasons, perhaps the most being that multimodality is *the same thing*; either way we translate it into vectors.  The major reason why it's proposed to help is that it provides a jump in generalization because the inputs are more diverse.",
        "(2) Yeah, definitely stability issues are key!\n(3) Also agreed. \n\nI absolutely agree that you’re right and continuous optimisation can be solved in the current framework in theory. I just think that in practice it will be a mega-suboptimal way to do that (evident by the fact that the brain does all that thing we want from AGI and runs on beer and nachos while o1 needs billions worth of compute). So, I believe, we’ll see a paradigm shift before AGI is built. \n\nI think I should have been more cautious with the choice of words in the post since I don’t think it’s impossible, but I do think it’s far from optimal and the amount of money required makes it borderline impossible in practice. Appreciate your feedback!",
        "Oh I agree it’s not optimal. We’re essential burning tons of carbon doing dense tensor ops on silicon when realistically the things we want to achieve with AGI can execute much more efficiently on specialized hardware (proof of concept is the human brain). And we’re throwing hundreds of thousands of people at the problem when a self guided algorithm may be more ideal.\n\nI guess the question seemed to more be a “can we achieve it” rather than a “can we achieve it efficiently”.",
        "Yeah, apologies for that! Really drugged you into an unnecessary discussion here. \n\nIn theory, definitely possible, in practice I just think that making the updates anywhere near fast enough, especially as we move into multimodality and robot-sourced data, will be too much even for the giants with unlimited funding = impossible in practice. I should revise the post to add as a more explicit difference."

    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nWhen it comes to classification of sounds/audio, it seems that the far majority of methods use a form of (Mel-) spectrogram (dB) as input. Then, the spectrogram is usually resampled to fit a normal picture size (256x256) for example. People seem to get good performance this way.\n\nFrom my experience in the acoustic domain this is really weird. When doing it this way, so much information is disregarded. For example, the signal phase is unused, fine frequency features are removed, etc.\n\nWhy are there little studies on using the raw waveform and why do those methods typically peform worse? A raw waveform contains much more information than the amplitude of a spectrogram is dB. I am really confused.\n\nAre there any papers/studies on this?\n",

        "The thing bugs me too, however we cannot take for granted the fact that phase holds that much useful information, or that the waveform does either.\n\n\nSound wave recordings are imho much more noisy than natural images, calling noise also information that is kind of useless.\nTake music: 120kHz mp3 sucks but there's no *semantic* difference between your favorite pop song in this format or in FLAC.\nCNNs are effective because they deal with an intensity measure over symmetric 2D planes, and they make do even with spectrograms, where translational equivariance in all directions just sounds wrong.\nInstead signals (from sound to EEG) have time as the principal axis of variation, and time is something we are not very good at.\nFrequency is simpler to deal with, if not more intuitive. Amplitude evenmoreso.\nTime, who knows it?\n\n\nUsing the raw waveform is often simply ineffective, because we haven't figured out good primitives or inductive biases, we don't know what kernel would be a smart initialization, a length 64 kernel could be a random wavelet or whatnot.\n3x3 kernels are more straightforward, random init is fine, and we also know how to initialize specific feature detectors in 2D, hence we can better interpret those that CNNs autonomously come up with, etc.\n\n\nLast but not least, if you check even superficially how the inner ear transduce soundwaves into neural signals, you'll see is much more of a spectrogram-amplitude-centric approach, rather than a waveform-centric approach (tl;dr there's membrane with a low end resonating with low frequencies and a high end resonating with higher frequencies, and below there are perfectly equal neurons just collectively checking which parts are vibing)",
        "I'd argue it's not dominated by vision:\n\n* HuBERT is one of the better human speech models - and it doesn't use images or spectrograms.     \nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07447\n* AVES is one of the better animal sound models - and it doesn't use images or spectrograms:     \nhttps://github.com/earthspecies/aves\n\nI'd say the main reason you see more papers using images is just because there are more computer-vision guys than audio guys, and they all want to publish papers.",
        "Because of the continuous distribution of the spectrogram.",
        "This is an interesting point! I’ve always thought it was kind of odd too, that sound is being treated like an image. It feels like we’re losing some of the richness of the audio itself by simplifying it into something visual, like a spectrogram. Maybe it's just easier for existing models, but I agree that using the raw waveform could capture so much more detail. I guess the challenge might be that raw data is harder to process effectively, so spectrograms have become the go-to for convenience and performance. It’d be really cool to see more research on how to get better results directly from waveforms.",
        "There have been huge amount of money invested into developing and training computer vision network, so it makes sense to try to use those models in other fields",
        "A lot of these networks learn the phase through other methods such as a Multi Period Discriminator or complex multiresolution stft discriminator if they are based on Mel spectrograms.  Others use some form of WaveNet architecture or transformers that learn time based dependencies. This information might not be in every part of the architecture, but it is usually addressed somewhere. This is not to say there shouldn’t be more research in this area. I do think audio is often the forgotten middle child in machine learning.",
        "There are a bunch of very competitive architectures that directly use the raw waveform like rawnet(v1 v2 v3) or wav2vec2 , wavlm , hubert, mms, xeus, wav2vec2-bert etc.\n\nAlso this is a natural way of exploiting both frequency and temporal information at the same time.",
        "A waveform is a 1D array, with sample rate of 44100 you get 44100 values per second. Meaning your network has to have receptive field of 44100 to see relationships between sounds 1 second apart. And second issue is that you can take a consistent low frequency in the waveform and shift it relative to other frequencies. That changes the waveform but doesn't change how it sounds.",
        "first of all i am a mod at /r/AudioAI and you should check it out, we are trying to grow :) \n\nsecond of all i know very little about this area (lol) but it still bugs me that in 2019 a friend of mine made a neural network that sampled and recreated midi tracks, fed it back into fruity loops, and made some pretty nice new compositions with some old n64 soundfonts, and four years later Suno comes out with these diffused and therefore very staticy sounding songs (which do in fact sound good, but...)\n\nhonestly you should try talking to some ML grad students at a local university. they will all be dying to do something interesting, their career really depends on writing papers on an underexplored topic. but as others have said, to do this shit kind of well you need a background in signal processing + knowledge of acoustics + ML skills, most people have zero of these and almost nobody has all three.\n\nif you get a decent model it is increasingly cheap to just rent a vm (or even a colab notebook) and run a model for a day and get something promising for like $20, and maybe get a little research grant from that. just need a really smart ML person to work with you on it. but this stuff is accessible and every student and university wants to be publishing papers on underexplored areas -- image and text processing are very overexplored already to the extent that, as you said, people are just using image processing on spectrograms.",
        "It's all about representation. A spectrogram is often a more informative basis for downstream tasks like classification. It's not the only one used, there are also other useful analyses like MFCCs, wavelet analysis, etc. However once they are in a 2D format like that, something like a CNN is a natural choice. You see both 1D and 2D CNNs in use.\n\n\nIt's not about preserving \"more information\", but rather about making more salient information (such as presence of specific frequencies) more readily available to the subsequent learned weights. Throwing out useless details ahead of time, for example by emphasizing certain frequencies and discarding others as done with a Mel basis, can both make learning easier and help with generalization.",
        "There are a lot of great answers in this thread already so I won't duplicate them, but I'd add one other thing which is that it's not uncommon for paradigms from one application of ML to get reused, often to great success, in other applications. \n\nIn this case we're talking about image based architectures on spectrograms, but look how many applications are now using transformer architecture (originally for NLP/sequence data): it's a stretch to say that vision transformers—which take little tiles of an image, treat them as items in a (2d) sequence, and then pass them into a transformer—are truly leveraging inductive bias specific to images, but they seem to work quite well! Similarly, Word2Vec style embeddings have now been adapted to create vector representations of just about everything you can imagine. When something works well, we tend to try using it everywhere regardless of how well it matches on a more theoretical level.\n\nFor better or worse, ML is a very empirical field: results trump explainability or theoretical guarantees every time. (This is likely because we often use NNs to predict phenomena, not explain them, so the inner workings are often irrelevant so long as the outputs are correct.)\n\nAll of the above says nothing of the fact that spectrograms actually are a very powerful and information dense representation of audio! There's nothing inherently pure about a waveform. And technically you can add phase information to spectrogram based models, but often it's not necessary.",
        "Amount of information coming through spectrogram is enough to generalize well",
        "Simple. The short answer is that images could be understood as 2D waves viewed from above. If you'd like to learn more about this you can take a look at the jpeg specification. But generally, the ideas of classification carry from the vision to the audio domain.",
        "You are making valid points. I am curious how these things will evolve in the future. \n\nBut still, positional information is much more important in a spectrogram than in a typical image. For example a CNN does not care if the dog tail is in the upper or lower part of the picture, the output should still be dog and not cat. However, in a spectrogram the same frequency line sounds completely different in the bottom of the spectrogram vs the upper part (higher frequencies). \nThat's why it worries me when all sorts of flips and translations are performed as data augmentation, because it is non-physical. Except time-shift, of course.",
        "Thank you for sharing these models! I was not familiar with them. Will look into it",
        "Why do you sound like Claude? Lol.",
        "Good to know that subreddit exists! I will check it out. As you said, not many people have those three skillsets. My background is mainly in signal processing and acoustics. But recently I have started some projects involving ML. I know a thing or two about the SOTA, but not all the fine tips and tricks. Interesting to see the approaches of ML experts to sound classification. As an example, the top-10 of the BirdCLEF competitions on Kaggle all use mel-spectrograms.",
        "That is regularization, it's a separate though related matter.\nI wouldn't take for granted that the network actually learns to take for good augmented images, and that's not the point of augmentations in general.\nAnyway, you can and should whatever augmentations you find appropriate and effective, not more.\nShift equivariance is an inherent property of the Convolutional layer; rotation invariance is a property approximated through learning with rotation augmentations, which you can definitely turn off.\nShift equivariance in time is a must have, shift equivariance in frequency should not be dismissed: a melody is \"semantically\" the same, whatever the key, and C4 and C5 are both C. The exact frequency is not very meaningful, but the interval is",
        "I kind of agree with our point here. Something like a Harmonic Kernel, like dilated convolution would seem to be a better idea, compared to a compact 3x3 kernel.\n\nUltimately, the invariance property you're describing about convolutional kernels not caring about absolute position in an image is not a property that's automatically guaranteed. If you reduce an image to a vector using a Flatten Operation, as opposed to something like Global Max Pooling, then you would be encoding position information into your final output. Likewise, we can also reason that the signal may have characteristic differences in each bin, and randomly selected binning and coefficient scaling is likely to exacerbate this issue which the network might also be able to identify.",
        "Gottcha ! Since Deep Learning is a community with around 168K members, I use Claude to ensure my posts are free of grammatical errors thats it ."

In other words the fastest route from A to B is also the route that accounts (to some extent, because it's not the only important thing) for traffic lights. Therefore Google Maps, Waze etc. doesn't need explicit knowledge of where red and green lights are.\n\nMy opinion is that, in a world with perfect datasets, my coworker would be right. But we don't know if Google Maps and other AI-based route suggestion apps truly have the data they need to suggest the \"true best route\". It's possible that their team just worked with the data they had, and created an app that provides very good suggestions. But an app with explicit knowledge of traffic lights might help you choose a route with more green lights, thus a smoother and faster ride. ",

    "title": "The Prompt Report: Prompting techniques survey",
    "selftext": "Prompt engineering, while not universally liked, has shown improved performance for specific datasets and use cases. Prompting has changed the model training paradigm, allowing for faster iteration without the need for extensive retraining.\n\n>**Follow the Blog for more such articles:** [**https://medium.com/aiguys**](https://medium.com/aiguys)\n\nSix major categories of prompting techniques are identified: Z***ero-Shot, Few-Shot, Thought Generation, Decomposition, Ensembling, and Self-Criticism***. But in total there are 58 prompting techniques.\n\n**1. Zero-shot Prompting**\n\nZero-shot prompting involves asking the model to perform a task without providing any examples or specific training. This technique relies on the model's pre-existing knowledge and its ability to understand and execute instructions.\n\nKey aspects:\n\nStraightforward and quick to implement\n\nUseful for simple tasks or when examples aren't readily available\n\nCan be less accurate for complex or nuanced tasks\n\nPrompt: \"Classify the following sentence as positive, negative, or neutral: 'The weather today is absolutely gorgeous!'\"\n\n\n\n**2. Few-shot Prompting**\n\nFew-shot prompting provides the model with a small number of examples before asking it to perform a task. This technique helps guide the model's behavior by demonstrating the expected input-output pattern.\n\nKey aspects:\n\nMore effective than zero-shot for complex tasks\n\nHelps align the model's output with specific expectations\n\nRequires careful selection of examples to avoid biasing the model\n\nPrompt: \"Classify the sentiment of the following sentences:\n\n1. 'I love this movie!' - Positive\n\n2. 'This book is terrible.' - Negative\n\n3. 'The weather is cloudy today.' - Neutral\n\nNow classify: 'The service at the restaurant was outstanding!'\"\n\n\n\n**3. Thought Generation Techniques**\n\nThought generation techniques, like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, encourage the model to articulate its reasoning process step-by-step. This approach often leads to more accurate and transparent results.\n\nKey aspects:\n\nImproves performance on complex reasoning tasks\n\nProvides insight into the model's decision-making process\n\nCan be combined with few-shot prompting for better results\n\nPrompt: \"Solve this problem step-by-step:\n\nIf a train travels 120 miles in 2 hours, what is its average speed in miles per hour?\n\nStep 1: Identify the given information\n\nStep 2: Recall the formula for average speed\n\nStep 3: Plug in the values and calculate\n\nStep 4: State the final answer\"\n\n\n\n**4. Decomposition Methods**\n\nDecomposition methods involve breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable sub-problems. This approach helps the model tackle difficult tasks by addressing each component separately.\n\nKey aspects:\n\nUseful for multi-step or multi-part problems\n\nCan improve accuracy on complex tasks\n\nAllows for more focused prompting on each sub-problem\n\nExample:\n\nPrompt: \"Let's solve this problem step-by-step:\n\n1. Calculate the area of a rectangle with length 8m and width 5m.\n\n2. If this rectangle is the base of a prism with height 3m, what is the volume of the prism?\n\nStep 1: Calculate the area of the rectangle\n\nStep 2: Use the area to calculate the volume of the prism\"\n\n\n\n**5. Ensembling**\n\nEnsembling in prompting involves using multiple different prompts for the same task and then aggregating the responses to arrive at a final answer. This technique can help reduce errors and increase overall accuracy.\n\nKey aspects:\n\nCan improve reliability and reduce biases\n\nUseful for critical applications where accuracy is crucial\n\nMay require more computational resources and time\n\nPrompt 1: \"What is the capital of France?\"\n\nPrompt 2: \"Name the city where the Eiffel Tower is located.\"\n\nPrompt 3: \"Which European capital is known as the 'City of Light'?\"\n\n(Aggregate responses to determine the most common answer)\n\n\n\n**6. Self-Criticism Techniques**\n\nSelf-criticism techniques involve prompting the model to evaluate and refine its own responses. This approach can lead to more accurate and thoughtful outputs.\n\nKey aspects:\n\nCan improve the quality and accuracy of responses\n\nHelps identify potential errors or biases in initial responses\n\nMay require multiple rounds of prompting\n\nInitial Prompt: \"Explain the process of photosynthesis.\"\n\nFollow-up Prompt: \"Review your explanation of photosynthesis. Are there any inaccuracies or missing key points? If so, provide a revised and more comprehensive explanation.\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/16uezmsog9wd1.png?width=650&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc4d091777d4dd2d2a73ca367ed4148ff9a6c818\n\n",

    "selftext": "I apologize in advance for the somewhat vague question, but I'll do my best to articulate my thoughts. Please keep in mind I don't have a formal math background but I've been doing applied deep learning for about 4 years now.\n\nI am interested to know if there's a way to quantify the amount of information in an arbitrary representation of data. I am familiar with information theory at a surface level, but looking to take the next step into understanding it for designing encodings for neural networks.\n\nAn interesting 'phenomena' I've come across while training models for problems at work is related to the garbage-in-garbage-out principle with supervised learning. As my upstream encodings/initial representations improve to contain more relevant information to tackling the task at hand, the more the model improves. Kind of a no brainer, but I see it as adding information to the encoding that makes the input 'manifold' of data more separable along certain dimensions.\n\nFor example, a 3D point cloud contains information about the correlation functions that relate x, to y, to z. Thus, if I have an embedding or representation of the point cloud, it also inherently captures the underlying correlations. If the information about the correlations are important for modelling some task, then the cloud should serve as an effective input representation, because it contains the information that will make it separable when the model learns the set of transformations required. Is this an accurate statement?\n\nHow can I prove this 'information-by-association' in a formal way?\n\nIs there a way we take a formal approach to designing encodings that consider the required information for modelling the task, instead of randomly concatenating everything together that we think might be related to the problem?\n\nI think for modelling processes that are not understood, this is harder. But for processes that are completely understood (but expensive to carry out), I feel like there should be some way to quantify all the information needed (i.e just list out the steps of the algorithm and the info required at each step), and slowly build the encoding from that.\n\nThank you again for any information or links to resources that might put me on a path to articulating my question better.",

        "The term you're looking for is \"mutual information\"; this is a quantity that measures how much information one random variable has \"about\" another. You can treat your model inputs as a random variable, and your model outputs as a random variable, and calculate the mutual information between the two. \n\nIn theory, anyway. In practice it can be quite hard to measure mutual information using actual data. \n\nA related term is \"information bottleneck\". People usually create and embedding/encoding of much smaller dimension than the input data. The idea is that this forces the model to learn to discard irrelevant information (as determined by the loss function) during training, and so the information that remains in the embedding is what matters the most for the task.",
        "Thank you for your response-- I will check out mutual information. And yes, I am currently building a few point cloud autoencoders because I want embeddings that capture/represent probability density functions. Since PDFs contain information about the functions that relate each random variable to each other, I was wondering if I could state that such an embedding (point cloud latent representation) would, by extension, also capture information related to the correlation functions between the axes. Intuitively this makes sense, but intuition doesn't cut it in a paper or formal writeup :)\n\nI will check out your first point. Thanks again!",

Sample frames in the buffer to a model that IDs frames with cars. When a car is found, grab more frames from the buffer and send them to a model to find license plates. You could use something like mask r cnn to isolate the plates. Send the isolations to your OCR model. That will get you a bunch of potential plate numbers from the multiple frames. Rig up some scripts to compile the most commonly found characters in the plates. Print it to a text file.\n\nI would break it into as many models as possible. I've personally found that your results will be more accurate if every model handles a small problem. Sometimes i will use 3 or more models to handle just one problem. I like to train refining models on the failures of the first models.\n\nIDing models of cars is going to be a tough train, assuming you can even get enough data to train that.

At Rapid Labs, I specialize in developing advanced AI solutions, and I believe I can help you achieve the accuracy you’re looking for.\n\nGiven your current approach using TF-IDF and cosine similarity, I recommend transitioning to a neural network-based solution. A model that employs natural language processing (NLP) techniques, such as word embedding or transformers, can significantly improve the accuracy of product name matching by better understanding the context and semantic meaning behind the names. I would utilize your dataset of previously correct matches to train a neural network model, allowing it to learn the specific patterns and variations in product names from sellers.\n\nI can explore pre-trained models, like BERT or similar transformer-based architectures, and fine-tune them on your dataset. This approach has proven effective in previous projects I’ve worked on, such as the **Cardio Chatbot**, where I achieved over 95% accuracy in a complex data input scenario. This significantly reduced the manual effort required for data validation.\n\nI would love the opportunity to discuss this further and explore how I can help optimize your product-matching process.

    "title": "[R] Unveiling the Mistral 7B: Exploring the Technical Architecture of a 7-Billion Parameter Transformer Model",
    "selftext": "# The Mistral AI model, specifically Mistral 7B, is a dense transformer-based model with 7 billion parameters, designed for efficient performance and state-of-the-art language tasks. To create a technical architecture diagram for this model, I will break down the structure of a typical transformer-based architecture, which forms the backbone of the Mistral AI model.\n\n# Key Components:\n\n1. **Input Layer (Tokenization)**:\n\n* Text input is tokenized into numerical representations using sub-word tokenization (likely based on Byte-Pair Encoding, BPE).\n\n**2. Embedding Layer**:\n\n* Converts tokenized input into dense vector representations (embeddings).\n* Positional embeddings are added to maintain the order of the input sequence, as transformers are permutation-invariant.\n\n**3. Transformer Blocks** (Main Architecture):\n\n**Multi-Head Self-Attention**:\n\n* The core mechanism where the model attends to different parts of the sequence to gather context.\n* Multiple attention heads allow the model to focus on different parts of the input simultaneously.\n\n**Layer Normalization**:\n\n* Applied before and after the attention mechanism and feed-forward layers to stabilize training.**Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFN)**:\n* Two fully connected layers with a ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation in between, applied to each token independently.\n\n**Residual Connections**:\n\n* Skip connections that bypass the multi-head attention and feed-forward layers to help with gradient flow during training.\n\n1. Stacking Transformer Layers:\n\nEach Transformer layer includes two primary components:\n\n* **Multi-Head Attention**: This layer allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence in parallel, improving the capture of context across long sequences.\n* **Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FFN)**: After the attention mechanism, the output passes through a fully connected feed-forward network, applying non-linear transformations to improve model expressiveness.\n\n**5. Stacking Transformer Layers** (continued):\n\n* These transformer blocks are stacked in multiple layers (typically 28–32) to build a deep neural network capable of learning complex language patterns. Each layer consists of a multi-head self-attention mechanism, layer normalization, and feed-forward networks.\n* The deeper the network, the better the model captures hierarchical features and long-term dependencies in the input sequence.\n\n**6. Output Layer**:\n\n* After passing through all the transformer layers, the final output from the last layer is projected back to the vocabulary size to generate predictions.\n* **Softmax Function**: The model generates a probability distribution over the vocabulary for the next word prediction or task output, using the softmax function.\n\n**7. Training and Fine-tuning**:\n\n* **Loss Function**: Cross-entropy loss is typically used for training, especially for language modeling tasks where the goal is to predict the next word or sequence of words.\n* The model is pre-trained on large corpora of text data and can be fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks (e.g., text classification, summarization, or dialogue).\n\n**8. Optimizations for Efficiency**:\n\n* **Sparse Attention Mechanisms (potential future models)**: While Mistral 7B is a dense model, future models may adopt sparse attention techniques to improve efficiency.\n* **Quantization and Weight Sharing**: Techniques such as 4-bit quantization or weight sharing could be applied to reduce the memory footprint and inference time without sacrificing much performance.\n* **Mixed Precision Training**: Using 16-bit floating-point precision for training helps reduce memory consumption and speed up the model training.\n\n**9. Parallelism and Scaling**:\n\n* **Data Parallelism**: Multiple GPUs or TPUs can be used to distribute data across batches during training.\n* **Model Parallelism**: Large models like Mistral 7B require splitting model parameters across different GPUs/TPUs due to memory constraints.\n* **Pipeline Parallelism**: Distributes different layers of the model across multiple devices to allow parallel training of different parts of the architecture.\n* **Checkpointing**: For efficient training of large models, techniques like gradient checkpointing are used to reduce memory consumption by saving intermediate layer outputs only when necessary.",

        "This is of course up to your budget. Since Intel is kind of struggling at the moment I would probably go with AMD. Most of the heavy lifting is done by the GPU anyways so for your tasks you can probably get away with any modern Zen 5 AMD CPU. However, I would not choose one of the 3D cache variants since they are more expensive and usually only provide benefits when it comes to gaming.\n\nIf your code relies heavily on multiprocessing and parallel computations you might want to look into something with more cores like the Ryzen 9 9900X (12 cores) or 9950X (16 cores).\n\nHowever, I think 6 to 8 performance cores are more than enough for most tasks. So 9600X (6 cores) or 9700X (8 cores) will give you one of the best single core performance and still decent multiprocessing.\n\nIf you are on a budget you could go for an older Zen 4 CPU like the 7700X (8 cores). If you are still unsure Google for some CPU benchmarks and compare their performance and prices. Hope that helps."

I’ll also share the challenges I faced and key takeaways to help you better navigate your next machine learning project.\n\nI selected the dataset from Kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mragpavank/heart-diseaseuci](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mragpavank/heart-diseaseuci)\n\nI worked on it through Google Colab: [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1inRCRFMqbXu3G615ZOSe45tCil1WqMNk?usp=sharing](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1inRCRFMqbXu3G615ZOSe45tCil1WqMNk?usp=sharing)\n\nYou can also view it in my GitHub via: [https://github.com/YanLAMgg/Heart-disease-prediction-evaluation](https://github.com/YanLAMgg/Heart-disease-prediction-evaluation)\n\n# Understanding the Data and Business Logic\n\nHeart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and building a predictive model to identify high-risk individuals can greatly assist in early diagnosis and prevention. My dataset, available on public repositories, consisted of various features, including age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, maximum heart rate, and more. Each of these features is an indicator of heart health.\n\nWhen approaching the dataset, I focused on understanding the relationships between these variables and how they correlate with the risk of heart disease. This step was crucial because, before jumping into the model, it’s essential to recognize which factors are more predictive. A strong understanding of the business logic behind heart disease helped in selecting relevant features that could significantly influence model outcomes.\n\nFor instance, features such as **chest pain type**, **maximum heart rate**, and **st\\_depression** proved to be important in predicting heart disease as they have direct physiological implications on heart health. Using correlation heatmaps and SHAP values, I was able to further solidify which features would have the greatest predictive impact.\n\n# Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering\n\nPreprocessing is the cornerstone of any successful machine learning model. For this heart disease project, I had to deal with missing values, encode categorical variables (such as chest pain type and sex), and scale numerical features to ensure uniformity.\n\nI used Label Encoding to convert categorical features and standardized the numerical values to bring them within a uniform scale, which helps certain models (like SVM and Logistic Regression) perform better. The importance of this preprocessing step cannot be overstated — if not done properly, it can significantly degrade your model’s performance.\n\n# Key Preprocessing Steps:\n\n* **Handling Missing Data**: Imputation was used for missing values in certain features.\n* **Feature Encoding**: Categorical features like sex and chest pain type were label-encoded for model compatibility.\n* **Data Splitting**: The data was split into training and validation sets (75%/25%) to ensure our models generalize well on unseen data.\n\n# Building and Training the Models\n\nFor the model-building phase, I chose a variety of classification algorithms, including **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, **SVM**, and **Gradient Boosting**. Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and it’s crucial to understand when to use one over the other.\n\nHere’s a brief explanation of the models I used:\n\n* **Logistic Regression**: This was my baseline model, easy to interpret and effective for binary classification.\n* **Random Forest**: This ensemble method helps capture interactions between features that simpler models might miss.\n* **SVM**: Support Vector Machines are particularly good for separating classes in a high-dimensional feature space.\n* **Gradient Boosting**: This model iteratively improves on predictions by correcting the errors made by previous models.\n\nThe training process included using **train\\_test\\_split** from scikit-learn to ensure our model did not overfit to the training data. For model tuning, I applied **Grid Search** to optimize hyperparameters and achieve the best performance.\n\nThe training process included using **train\\_test\\_split** from scikit-learn to ensure our model did not overfit to the training data. For model tuning, I applied **Grid Search** to optimize hyperparameters and achieve the best performance.\n\n# Model Evaluation\n\nOne challenge I faced was selecting the right metric for model evaluation. Since this is a healthcare-related problem, accuracy alone wouldn’t suffice. In healthcare, predicting false negatives (failing to predict heart disease when it exists) can be life-threatening.\n\nTo address this, I focused on:\n\n* **Precision** (how many positive predictions were actually correct),\n* **Recall** (how many actual positives were correctly predicted), and\n* **F1-score**, which balances the trade-off between precision and recall.\n\nI used **ROC-AUC curves** to evaluate the models’ performance across different thresholds, ensuring the models could generalize well to new, unseen data.\n\n# Visualizing Model Impact with SHAP and Permutation Importance\n\nTo understand which features most influenced the model’s predictions, I utilized **SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations)**. SHAP values explain the contribution of each feature to the model’s output, offering transparency and helping stakeholders understand how the model makes decisions.\n\nFor example, **num\\_major\\_vessels** and **chest pain type** turned out to be key drivers for heart disease prediction. Such insights were visually represented using SHAP plots and were incredibly useful in explaining the model to non-technical audiences, especially when the decisions of the model affect real-world health outcomes.\n\n# Challenges and Key Takeaways\n\nWhile working on this project, I encountered several challenges, such as:\n\n* **Handling imbalanced data**: The dataset had more individuals without heart disease than with it, which posed a challenge for model generalization.\n* **Feature Engineering**: Understanding which features were truly predictive required both domain knowledge and thorough experimentation with feature selection methods.\n* **Model Selection**: Balancing precision and recall for a health-related problem was particularly important. I had to ensure the model was not only accurate but also capable of reducing false negatives.\n\nThrough this process, I realized the importance of **business context**, **model transparency**, and **evaluation metrics**. Every step, from data preprocessing to feature engineering, contributed to the success of the final model.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThis heart disease prediction project taught me the importance of deeply understanding the business problem, the careful handling of data, and the critical need to use the right evaluation metrics.

    "title": "[R] Exploring Customer Behaviors in Tourism: A Full Data Analysis and Model Training Walkthrough",
    "selftext": "As data-driven insights continue to transform industries, In this post, I’ll walk you through how I applied data analysis and machine learning to a tourism dataset. We’ll dive deep into the business logic behind the data, the entire process from data cleaning to building and validating models, common challenges, and the lessons I learned along the way. If you’re interested in a deeper look, the full project is available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/YanLAMgg/Customer_Behaviour_Tourism).\n\nThe project in my Google Colab is: [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SoEXsxCM\\_1piv4jbTVpzoQjDiu0z5-Rz?usp=sharing](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SoEXsxCM_1piv4jbTVpzoQjDiu0z5-Rz?usp=sharing)\n\nThe dataset is from Kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ddosad/customer-behaviour-tourism-portal](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ddosad/customer-behaviour-tourism-portal)\n\n# Understanding the Business Logic of the Dataset\n\nThe dataset I used is focused on customer behaviors on a tourism platform. Key features include information like the number of yearly page views, preferred travel destinations, and customer interaction metrics (e.g., likes, comments, and check-ins).\n\nFrom a business perspective, understanding these behaviors is crucial for tourism companies. By analyzing these trends, businesses can:\n\n* Predict which customers are likely to purchase tourism products.\n* Optimize content based on device preferences.\n* Identify key factors driving customer engagement.\n\nThis leads us to our main objectives:\n\n1. **Predict customer purchase behavior** based on their online activity.\n2. **Understand factors influencing user engagement** with tourism content.\n\n# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: A Vital First Step\n\nBefore diving into modeling, I encountered typical data preprocessing challenges, such as missing values and inconsistent formats. The dataset had about 5% missing data, primarily in fields like *preferred location type* and *social interactions*. Since the missing rate was below 20%, I opted to remove rows with missing data instead of imputation, ensuring minimal statistical impact.\n\nFor categorical variables like device types and travel preferences, I used label encoding, which converts categories into numeric labels for easier processing in machine learning models. This was particularly useful for features like *preferred device* (iOS, Android, etc.).\n\n# Key Issues Faced:\n\n* **Data imbalance**: The target variable (whether a user purchased a product) was highly skewed. To address this, I considered techniques like oversampling and model performance evaluation using metrics beyond accuracy, such as precision and recall.\n* **Categorical inconsistencies**: Variants of the same device (e.g., “Android,” “ANDROID”) required careful preprocessing to avoid misleading insights.\n\n# Model Training: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests\n\nAfter cleaning the data, I experimented with a range of classification models to predict whether a customer would purchase a product. I started with simple models like Logistic Regression, then moved to more advanced algorithms like Decision Trees and Random Forests.\n\n# Logistic Regression\n\nLogistic Regression is often a good starting point because of its simplicity and interpretability. However, due to the nonlinear relationships in the data, Logistic Regression had difficulty in achieving high precision on the minority class (those who purchased a product).\n\n# Decision Trees\n\nDecision Trees were more flexible, capturing nonlinear patterns in the data. The feature importance generated by Decision Trees indicated that customer engagement metrics like *number of comments* and *likes* were critical in predicting purchase behavior.\n\n# Random Forest\n\nTo further boost performance, I used a Random Forest classifier, which combines multiple decision trees to reduce overfitting and improve accuracy. This model outperformed both Logistic Regression and a standalone Decision Tree.\n\nThe key takeaway here is that ensemble methods like Random Forests are powerful for handling non-linear data and can outperform simpler models when tuned properly.\n\n# Key Features Influencing Purchase Behavior\n\nThrough feature importance analysis, I found that:\n\n1. **User engagement** (e.g., total likes given and received) had the greatest influence on purchase behavior.\n2. **Device preference**: Users accessing the platform from mobile devices showed higher engagement, likely because of the convenience factor in travel research and bookings.\n3. **Travel frequency and destination preferences**: Users who frequently check-in at outstation locations or engage with travel pages are more likely to purchase products.\n\n# Model Validation and Common Pitfalls\n\nCross-validation was used to ensure model generalizability. For Random Forest, I used 5-fold cross-validation and achieved an average accuracy of **98.7%** across all folds.\n\nOne common pitfall during model validation was overfitting, especially with Decision Trees. To mitigate this, I carefully tuned hyperparameters like *max\\_depth* and *min\\_samples\\_split*. Random Forest naturally handles overfitting better due to its ensemble nature.\n\n# Common Issues Encountered:\n\n* **Imbalanced classes**: Models performed well in predicting users who did not purchase, but struggled with the minority class. Using metrics like AUC and F1-score helped better assess model performance.\n* **Feature scaling**: Some algorithms like Logistic Regression required scaling for optimal performance, while tree-based models did not.\n\n# What I Learned\n\nThis project reinforced a few critical lessons:\n\n1. **Data preprocessing is key**: Data imbalances and missing values are common, and handling them appropriately is crucial to building robust models.\n2. **Model selection matters**: Simpler models like Logistic Regression may not capture complex relationships. Tree-based models like Random Forests offer better performance in such cases.\n3. **Understanding business context is crucial**: The best features for predicting purchases were not necessarily obvious. By understanding user engagement and behavior patterns, I was able to make more informed feature selections.\n\n# Conclusion and Next Steps\n\nThrough this project, I was able to demonstrate how different machine learning models can be applied to predict customer behavior in the tourism industry. The results of the Random Forest classifier were particularly promising for predicting user purchases based on their social interactions and engagement metrics. I encourage you to check out the full code and results on my GitHub.\n\nIn the future, I aim to refine the model further by incorporating additional data, such as real-time social media interactions, and applying more sophisticated models like gradient boosting to see if even higher accuracy can be achieved.",

    "title": "[R] Analyzing Mental Health Depression Data: A Comprehensive Walkthrough of Data Science and Machine Learning",
    "selftext": "As I decided to dive in ML and DL that I selected a topic which is about Mental Health Depression. The dataset is from\n\n[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/uncover-global-trends-in-mental-health-disorder/data.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/uncover-global-trends-in-mental-health-disorder/data.)\n\nIn the ever-growing world of data science, mental health is a domain where data can uncover valuable insights. For this project, I took on the challenge of analyzing the Mention Health Depression dataset, which tracks various mental health disorders across populations. My goal was to build machine learning models to predict depression levels based on different disorders. In this article, I’ll share my process, challenges, insights, and how I deployed these models for public viewing on my GitHub: [https://github.com/YanLAMgg](https://github.com/YanLAMgg)\n\nYou can take a look when you feel free as there’re other showcases in my GitHub\n\nI also use Google Colab to work on it: [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GuZFwkAJkHp9HQvDdEWppA\\_vkTDfQ4Mh?usp=sharing](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GuZFwkAJkHp9HQvDdEWppA_vkTDfQ4Mh?usp=sharing)\n\n# Understanding the Data\n\nThe first and perhaps the most critical part of any data science project is understanding the business logic behind the data. The Mention Health Depression dataset primarily focuses on depression percentages across different regions, along with various factors such as:\n\n* **Anxiety disorders (%)**\n* **Drug use disorders (%)**\n* **Alcohol use disorders (%)**\n* **Bipolar disorder (%)**\n* **Eating disorders (%)**\n\nI started by exploring how these disorders correlated with depression. The business logic was simple yet powerful: by understanding the influence of other disorders, we can better predict depression rates. This understanding became the backbone of the feature selection and engineering phase.\n\n# Data Preprocessing and Analysis\n\n**1. Correlation Analysis:**  \nI began by dropping irrelevant columns like “Entity” and “Year” and computed the correlation between each mental disorder and depression. Not surprisingly, **Anxiety disorders** and **Drug use disorders** had the strongest correlations with depression rates.\n\n**2. Removing Low Variance Features:**  \nLow variance in features means little to no predictive power. I used a variance threshold to filter out these features. This ensured that only those with enough variation across the dataset were considered for the model.\n\n**3. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE):**  \nTo refine my feature set, I employed Recursive Feature Elimination with **RandomForestRegressor**. This approach highlighted the most influential features — **Alcohol use disorders**, **Anxiety disorders**, and **Drug use disorders** — which became the final inputs to my models.\n\n# Challenges Along the Way\n\n**Dealing with Missing Data:**  \nOne common challenge in real-world datasets is missing values. I used a simple imputer strategy to fill in missing values with the median, a robust approach that prevents outliers from skewing the data.\n\n**Handling NaNs with Support Vector Regression (SVR):**  \nInitially, SVR failed due to NaN values that slipped through, despite my data preprocessing. I resolved this by revisiting and validating the dataset before training.\n\n**Maintaining Variables Between Colab Sessions:**  \nThroughout the process, I encountered issues with Colab losing variable states upon disconnection. I solved this by saving preprocessed data and models at each key step using **joblib**. This allowed me to reload the data and models without retraining when reconnecting.\n\n# Model Training and Evaluation\n\nWith the data preprocessed, I experimented with three different models:\n\n1. **Linear Regression**\n2. **RandomForestRegressor**\n3. **Support Vector Regressor (SVR)**\n\nAfter splitting the data into training and testing sets, I fit these models and evaluated them using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, and **R² Score**.\n\n# Results and Model Performance\n\nRandomForestRegressor performed significantly better than the others, achieving an MSE of **0.0007689** and an R² of **0.9701**, which indicated a strong fit. This was followed by Linear Regression and SVR, both of which had lower R² scores, indicating weaker predictive performance.\n\nThe superior performance of RandomForest was anticipated given its ability to capture non-linear relationships, unlike linear models.\n\n# Explainability with SHAP\n\nTo add an interpretability layer, I used **SHAP** (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to explain my RandomForest model. SHAP allowed me to see the contribution of each feature to a single prediction. This is critical when dealing with health data, where explainability is paramount for real-world use.\n\n# Lessons Learned\n\n1. **Business Logic is Key:** Without understanding how mental disorders affect depression, the model would be ineffective. Data science is more than numbers — context matters.\n2. **Feature Selection Drives Success:** Careful feature selection via correlation analysis, variance filtering, and RFE dramatically improved model performance.\n3. **Persistence Between Colab Sessions:** A recurring challenge was losing variables after a Colab session ended. This was solved by systematically saving models and variables and reloading them when needed.\n4. **Model Explainability is Crucial:** Building an accurate model is not enough, especially in sensitive fields like healthcare. Using SHAP made the model more transparent, enhancing its credibility.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWorking through the Mention Health Depression dataset taught me a great deal about the importance of understanding the underlying business logic and how to handle the intricacies of machine learning workflows. From data preprocessing to model evaluation and SHAP-based explainability, every step plays a crucial role in building effective, interpretable models.\n\nFor anyone interested in seeing the full code and project, please visit my GitHub repository.

    "title": "[P] Mastering Fashion MNIST with Convolutional Neural Networks: Challenges and Solutions",
    "selftext": "I worked on the deep learning practicing project in my Colab:[https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xo-bozv3FV39BGotK93FtWtHO2632w4U?usp=sharing](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xo-bozv3FV39BGotK93FtWtHO2632w4U?usp=sharing)\n\nThe dataset is loaded directly from TensorFlow’s `datasets` module, which provides a simple way to access the data.\n\nThe Fashion MNIST dataset, which contains 28x28 grayscale images of various fashion items, has become a popular benchmark for image classification tasks. It challenges us to build deep learning models that can classify items into 10 categories, such as T-shirts, shoes, or dresses. In this article, I’ll share the journey of developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for Fashion MNIST, the challenges I faced, and how I resolved them to achieve better model performance.\n\n# The Approach: Logical Thinking in Model Design\n\nWhen tackling any deep learning task, it’s essential to start with a structured, logical approach. The process typically involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the Data**: Before diving into model building, it’s critical to know the nature of the dataset and the problem at hand. Fashion MNIST contains 70,000 grayscale images, 60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing, each categorized into one of 10 classes.\n2. **Preprocessing the Data**: A standard part of any deep learning workflow is ensuring the data is preprocessed correctly. This involves normalizing the pixel values of the images to a range of \\[0, 1\\] and reshaping them to be compatible with the network input. Additionally, labels are one-hot encoded to make them suitable for multi-class classification tasks.\n3. **Building the Model**: Given the nature of the Fashion MNIST dataset, I chose to implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CNNs are highly effective at processing images because they use convolutional layers to extract hierarchical features from the input data, making them well-suited for image classification tasks.\n\n# Initial Problems Encountered\n\nAt first, I designed a basic CNN model, but when I trained the model, the results were far from satisfactory. The model’s **accuracy stagnated around 10%**, which is equivalent to random guessing. Moreover, the **loss value remained constant** around 2.3027 — the expected initial loss for a random classifier.\n\nThis led to the realization that something fundamental was wrong with the model or its training process. The key issues I encountered were:\n\n1. **No Improvement in Accuracy**: Despite multiple training epochs, the accuracy stayed at 10%, suggesting that the model was not learning any meaningful features from the data.\n2. **Loss Did Not Decrease**: The loss value stayed constant, indicating that the weights in the network were not being updated effectively during training.\n\n# Analyzing the Issues: Applying Logical Thinking\n\nAt this point, it was necessary to go back to the drawing board and think logically about the issues. Here are some of the potential causes I considered:\n\n1. **Learning Rate Problems**: If the learning rate is too high, the model may “skip over” the optimal points during weight updates, leading to stagnation in both accuracy and loss.\n2. **Model Complexity**: A model that is too simple might not have the capacity to learn complex features from the dataset, especially for tasks like image classification, where multiple layers of abstraction are often needed.\n3. **Weight Initialization**: Poor initialization of weights can cause the model to start from a bad point in the optimization space, making it hard to improve.\n4. **Data Preprocessing**: Improper data preprocessing (e.g., not normalizing pixel values or mislabeling data) can hinder the model’s ability to learn from the data effectively.\n\n# Solutions: Improving the Model and Training Process\n\nArmed with these insights, I implemented several improvements to resolve the problems:\n\n# 1. Adjusting the Learning Rate\n\nOne of the first adjustments I made was to lower the learning rate in the Adam optimizer. A high learning rate can cause the model to converge too quickly to a suboptimal point, whereas a lower learning rate allows for smaller, more careful steps in the optimization process. I changed the learning rate to 0.0001, which provided a more controlled learning process.\n\n    model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.0001),\n                  loss='categorical_crossentropy',\n                  metrics=['accuracy'])\n\n# 2. Enhancing the Model Architecture\n\nNext, I revisited the model architecture. The original CNN model was too shallow to capture complex features in the dataset. To address this, I added additional convolutional layers and increased the number of filters in each layer. This allowed the network to learn more abstract, high-level features from the images, such as textures and shapes.\n\n    model = models.Sequential([\n        layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),\n        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),\n        layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),\n        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),\n        layers.Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'),\n        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),\n        layers.Flatten(),\n        layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),\n        layers.Dropout(0.5),\n        layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')\n    ])\n\nThis deeper network improved the model’s ability to extract richer features from the images, improving accuracy significantly.\n\n# 3. Adding Batch Normalization\n\nBatch normalization is a technique used to stabilize and accelerate the training process by normalizing the inputs to each layer. This helps reduce the sensitivity of the model to weight initialization and learning rate choices. By adding batch normalization layers, I ensured that each layer received inputs on a consistent scale.\n\n    layers.BatchNormalization()\n\n# 4. Improving Data Preprocessing\n\nFinally, I reviewed my data preprocessing steps to ensure that the pixel values of the images were normalized to a \\[0, 1\\] range, and that the labels were properly one-hot encoded. Correct preprocessing ensures that the model starts with appropriate input values, which helps in learning.\n\n# Results After Improvements\n\nAfter making these improvements, the model showed significant progress. The accuracy increased beyond 90%, and the loss values decreased steadily during training. By fine-tuning the learning rate and increasing the model’s complexity, the network was able to learn more meaningful patterns from the data, leading to a robust classifier for Fashion MNIST.\n\n# Conclusion: The Power of Deep Learning\n\nThis project provided a clear demonstration of how powerful deep learning can be when applied to image classification tasks. However, it also highlighted the importance of logical thinking and problem-solving in machine learning. Building deep learning models is not just about throwing layers together and hoping for the best. It requires a systematic approach: identifying issues, thinking through potential solutions, and making incremental improvements.\n\nThrough adjustments in the model architecture, learning rate, and data preprocessing, I was able to take a CNN model that initially performed no better than random guessing and turn it into a highly accurate image classifier. This experience serves as a reminder that effective machine learning is as much about logical thinking and persistence as it is about having the right tools.\n\n# Next Steps\n\nFor anyone interested in experimenting with this dataset, I recommend trying to:\n\n1. Fine-tune the hyperparameters further to squeeze out additional performance.\n2. Experiment with advanced techniques like data augmentation to make the model more robust.\n3. Use transfer learning with pre-trained models like VGG16 or ResNet50 to see if you can achieve even better results.\n\nDeep learning is a vast field with a lot of potential, and each problem solved brings new learning opportunities.",

At that time, I was in my Post Graduation final year and used to follow their blogs for interview purpose. - About the material, I would say very great as they have a very huge specialised community base. - The curriculum was also prepared in a way that a newbie can also be a part and get the most out of it. - Tutors and mentors were also well known industry experts. - Placement team was also great as I have interviewed in more than 5 companies even before the completion of the course curriculum (As I was not a newbie). - In my batch, we had people from different domains and fields (Not specifically from even IT) but most of them got placed. - I am still working in the same company where I got placed through the bootcamp as a Senior specialist - Data scientist. Check the current stats of the placement as well !",
        "Hi, I completed a data science training program from Analytics Vidhya back in 2022, and I can share my experience. For context, I come from a commerce background, so I had no prior exposure to programming, machine learning, or anything related to IT. Honestly, I was nervous at the beginning, but the mentors were excellent—they broke down complex topics in a way that even someone like me could understand.\n\nBy the end of the program, not only did I feel confident in what I had learned, but Analytics Vidhya also helped align interviews for me. They connected me with a multinational company (MNC), and I was able to land the job. I’m still working there, and it’s been a great journey so far.\n\nBased on my experience, their programs are worthwhile. With the career support they provide after the program, as they did in my case, it could really help open doors for you in the field."

But I couldn't get it. If you understand it, please explain it to me.\n\nAs we know, the attention mechanism is powerful, because it can selectively pick the past info based on input. it won't simply make decision based on the entire history.\n\nThe Mamba paper is an improvement on top of state space models, by also adding a selection mechanism. Otherwise the state space models are like RNNs, they will remember the entire history as a compressed vector.\n\nI get this part. What I don't get is this: For RNN, the hidden state is the memory of the past, If we want to introduce selectivity, we should add it to the hidden state. I.e. for an input x, we want to select the relevant past information and save it in the hidden state.\n\nBut looking at the above Mamba diagram, the hidden state is the h, and the selection mechanism doesn't modify it directly. it only influence its updating. I don't think this is the same selection in the attention mechanism? I can't understand why this can select the relevant past context according to the current input?\n\nAt best, I think Mamba can selectively decide which input should influence the hidden state, whereas attention can remember everything in the past (within a window) and select relevant info based on input. I think attention is better, because the usefulness of a piece of info can't be decided at the input time, but at the decision time. I hence think Mamba is limited?",

        "The Mamba model introduces selectivity by influencing how the hidden state gets updated based on new inputs, which isn't quite the same as attention's direct past-info filtering. It's more like the model decides what new info should be incorporated into the hidden state rather than explicitly filtering past details. While attention can access all past info in a window, Mamba selectively updates the state in a structured way.",

While 2D inpainting works well for single images, it falls short when trying to generate consistent results across multiple views of the same scene.\n\nThe goal is to take multiple input images and generate a consistent representation of an object from different angles or perspectives, keeping the background context in mind. Essentially, it's about generating the same object across various viewpoints based on the camera's position.\n\nIs this problem solvable with current techniques? My understanding of ML theory isn't enough to figure out how this could be done effectively.\n\nIt seems somewhat similar to using LoRA, but in a 3D context where the object needs to be coherent across perspectives.

They're so simple and light you probably can't notice the difference, even if you were to run it in a hypervisor.\n\n\nThe only popular editor that doesn't work for Windows is Zed, which of course works on Linux, and by extension, WSL.\n\n\nSo the argument that Mac is in the lead here is dumb. It can probably only be accepted by people that, coincidentaly or not, think Macbooks have no competitors.\n\n\nNo OS has a clear lead on the ease of use regarding IDEs or Shells.

Tbh, if a MS graduate from a department with data science fields like AI/deep learning, cyber physical systems, or similar doesn't have that practical knowledge and experience, I'd highly question the quality of that department's graduate program.",

Having not gone through a masters program myself, I can’t speak to any individuals’ experience. \n\nWhat I *can* say is that practical commercial hands on experience with data trumps everything. Figuring out how to pull data from a company with a legacy data lake (teradata, mssql, whatever), some modern columnar database (snowflake, etc etc), blob storage (s3, gcloud), and/or figuring out schemas when there is no internal documentation and chasing down tech leads are problems you tend to see more often in commercial settings.

        "That's not what the topic was. No one is saying that real-world experience isn't valuable.

It's literally the experience you're trying to distinguish when MA students have to have that experience to get their degree.\n\nI'm not sure what you believe the experience MS students receive in their program. It's not some in-class project like you'd see in a BS program. It's real, business problems, usually with a local business, and offering solutions using the knowledge learned from the MS program.",

In real world, majority of the work in pipelines, infrastructure, device inference, library support, training efficiency, etc.\n\nMaster in CS with ML bent does not teach this.",
        ">In real world, majority of the work in pipelines, infrastructure, device inference, library support, training efficiency, etc.\n\nThis is part of the project component of getting the MS in most universities though. The only difference is you tend to have a set amount of time to do the work, assuming a 1-2y program (where 1y is spent on coursework and 1y is spent on the project or research+thesis if doing thesis route), but the actual experience involved with getting an MS is the same as \"real-world.\" The Master's program is meant to be modeled after business problems and solutions that you'd encounter in the working industry. If you do the thesis route, it's the same, except instead of business-focused work, it's more research- or lab-focused. Like, the MS program isn't just math/algorithms, model training, validation, etc. Model development is, relatively speaking, amongst the smallest portion of the workload. It takes a couple weeks, maybe a month, to get a highly trained model within the scope of a MS program because all the other work, such as \"work in pipelines, infrastructure, device inference, library support, training efficiency, etc.\" is done to make that process as efficient as possible. And remember, this is done over two semesters, at minimum, so at least ten months, assuming they're not also working over the summer, which is pretty common for MS students. If model development takes only roughly a month out of the ten spent on the project, the rest is spent on doing the other work associated with solving the problem.\n\nIf someone is doing a 1y track, then they're doing course or project, but these routes are usually for people who already have their career or they're job is paying for their Master's degree, so the \"real-world\" experience comparison from this route isn't really relevant because they're already in their career.\n\nHappy Cake Day! :D",

Granted, there are times where a business can be the one to find and offer a SOTA solution, it's almost never expected between the Master's-business relationship, and finding novel solutions solely on the business side tends to be done by PhD holders (of course, there are exceptions, but usually it's PhD, so it's not really relevant to Master's experience).\n\nAnd MS students don't need to have billions of dollars' worth of H100 to get real-world, practical experience. That's not the defining quality of MS work. No one ever expects a Master's student to do novel work, especially when they're doing the course or project route. That's not the purpose of those two tracks. If they did thesis, *maybe* they could, but that's still not expected. Either way, working with H100s doesn't have any bearing on whether a student gets real-world experience.\n\n>just data gathering and cleaning is something you will not learn in school\n\nIdk, this is definitely something we covered at my university where I got my MS and PhD. It's covered in different parts over multiple courses, but we were taught this, and if someone goes into the PhD program, they're expected to learn more about this, assuming it's within the scope of their work.\n\nObviously they're not teaching how to design the next ChatGPT or LLM in general, but just the concepts on what's needed to get you started on NLP, or other types of DL models and algorithms in general.\n\n>Look at UTexas MS/AI. One of the best tech schools, and it’s all theory.\n\n>https://cdso.utexas.edu/msai\n\nThis is an exception because this is an online Master's. Online Master's degrees don't have the same expectation of doing business-related projects to get their degree. Those are more comparable to the course track, not even the project track for Master's degrees. \"Real-world\" experience with a MS program comes from either the project track or thesis track, not course.\n\n>Mind you, a project where you have to do these things on your own isn’t learning how to do these things properly. So it doesn’t count.\n\nThis isn't how Master's projects are typically done though. You're not alone. You, at minimum, have an advisor, and probably are working in a lab or with some consortium of MS, PhD, and post-doc students to help you. And along with these, you'll have the business liason to help coordinate with the business you're working with to find solutions to the problem you're working on.",
        "Ofcourse you have an advisor… didn’t say you didn’t \n\nAnd if you’re hired to work in a lab where the prof is leading research for a business partner, that’s different than what we’re discussing because that work is very specific and not really related to core course work.\n\nDoing projects or a thesis doesn’t mean any practical work",
        ">Doing projects or a thesis doesn’t mean any practical work\n\nThe project or thesis would ideally be relevant to practical work. That's what I said before, the project path is usually done in collaboration with a local business, so it's practical work.\n\n>that’s different than what we’re discussing because that work is very specific and not really related to core course work.\n\nThe projects aren't part of core course work though, they just use the knowledge gained from it. Projects are their own separate things, usually coded as a graded course (or courses). I don't see how it's different just because you have a PI that's also working with businesses, when your project would also be giving you that real-world experience that's being claimed to be non-existent with Master's graduates.",
        "Dude it’s not the same lol.\n\nYou’re not knowledgeable about this.\n\nLike I’d said, you’re describing working in a lab that is either sponsored or funded by an industrial partner. Only a few individuals do that.\n\nI’m talking about regular course projects with/without an advisor. \n\nConcrete example:\n\nStudent A, doing Masters taught by Geoff Hinton, doing any project with/without an advisor is not equivalent to real world experience \n\nStudent B, working at Google Brain/Advised by Hinton himself for Hinton’s theoretical work, MAY have real world experience\n\nB, is an outlier, and only a few do that.\n\nA is normal course/poject, and offers very limited experience",

All I said was that the project route is not done alone.\n\n>B, is an outlier, and only a few do that.\n\nB is more akin to someone getting their Master's sponsored by their job. These people are already receiving real-world experience because they're already in the field. I already said this like two or three comments ago.\n\n>B, is an outlier, and only a few do that.\n\n>A is normal course/poject, and offers very limited experience\n\nNeither of that is what I'm talking about in regards to a student doing the project route and not currently in a career. What I'm saying is:\n\nStudent C is enrolled in a department that works with local businesses or government to that has problems that could possibly be addressed using machine- or deep learning (or whatever the department focuses on). The student or student's advisor is given a business/government liaison to communicate with that will help request resources, have meetings, etc., whatever is needed to properly describe the problem, find resources or data that could or would be useful to reaching a solution, come up with possible solutions, implement solution that addresses the original problem.\n\nC is a very common Master's project format which gives the student real-world experience and is on par with the same experience they would get on the job because, aside from the student being in academia instead of industry, they would essentially have done the same range of work to, 1) find and address a problem, and, 2) come up with solutions using the knowledge they learned within the scope of that field.\n\n>A is normal course/poject, and offers very limited experience\n\nThis is moving the goalpost because no one said one type of experience is more quantitative or qualitative than the other. The original comment was that Master's students don't have practical experience, period. You're trying to adjust the scope to saying one set of experience is limited than the other, which was never the topic of discussion.\n\n>you’re describing working in a lab that is either sponsored or funded by an industrial partner. Only a few individuals do that.\n\nThis is *very* common for research labs, and not just industrial partners, but government too. If you're arguing from a viewpoint of labs that aren't sponsored or funded by industrial or governmental partners, that's a stance focusing on a minority.\n\nMy very first response to you was:\n\n>That's not what the topic was. No one is saying that real-world experience isn't valuable. The response was that Master's students don't have practical experience, when that's not true.\n\nBecause you're talking about something that was never the topic of discussion. No one is talking about the comparison of experience. The topic was that Master's students don't have practical experience, which, again, is flat out not true. You even said this just now in your latest comment that they have practical experience. I don't understand what you're trying to argue against.\n\nYou say I'm not knowledgeable on this, yet you're arguing a point that no one was talking about and trying to then throw ad hominem attacks for no reason. From the very first comment I made as a reply to you, I made it clear that the topic was about the existence of practical experience. You're over here talking about edge cases of someone having x amount of experience compared to someone else having y amount of experience.\n\nI'm done replying to you since you refuse to stay on topic even after saying multiple times what you're arguing *is not* the topic of discussion, and you're unnecessarily using ad hominem attacks because you want to continue to talk about something that's not the topic of discussion and I'm trying to stay on that topic.\n\nHave a good whatever.",
        "I’m in the industry. I’ve been at both ends of the stick.\n\nWe reject a high amount of master students because they lack real world experience.\n\nFor the few purely research teams, they get accepted more there, but we prefer candidates with real world experience.\n\nIt is what it is. Goodluck with whatever you’re doing."

    "selftext": "Hi everyone, I am a working student in Germany and I've been assigned a solo project by my company, but I haven't received much guidance from my supervisor or a clear professional workflow to follow. I'm currently a second-year student in an AI Bachelor program.\n\nProject Overview: The project involves developing a Python GUI that enables users to perform an end-to-end deep learning workflow. The functionality includes: Annotating, augmenting, and preprocessing images; Creating deep learning models using custom configurations. The goal is to make this process code-free for the users. From the beginning, I was tasked with building both the backend (handling images and training DL models) and the frontend (user interface).\n\nProject Nature: I believe my project lies at the intersection of software engineering (70%) and deep learning (30%). My supervisor, a data scientist focused on deep learning research, doesn't provide much guidance on coding workflows. I also asked my colleagues, but they are developing C++ machine vision applications or researching machine algorithms. So they aren't familiar with this project. There's no pressing deadline, but I feel somewhat lost and need a professional roadmap.\n\nMy Approach and Challenges: I've been working on this for a few months and faced several challenges:\n+ Research Phase: I started by researching how to apply augmentations, use deep learning frameworks for different use cases, and build user interfaces.\n+ Technology Choices: I chose PyQt for the frontend and PyTorch for the backend.\n+ Initial Development: I initially tried to develop the frontend and backend simultaneously. This approach led to unstructured code management, and I ended up just fixing errors.\n\nInspiration and New Direction: Recently, I discovered that the Halcon deep learning tools have a similar application, but they use C++ and it's not open-source. Observing their data structure and interface gave me some insights. I realized that I should focus on building a robust backend first and then design the frontend based on that.\n\nCurrent Status and Concerns: I am currently in the phase of trial and error, often unsure if I'm on the right path. I constantly think about the overall architecture and workflow. I just realized that if I am given a task in a company, so it's straightforward. But if am given a solo project, it's kind of hard to define everything. \n\nI am seeking advice from professionals and senior engineers with experience in this field. Could you recommend a suitable workflow for developing this GUI, considering both software engineering and deep learning aspects?\n\nAnyways, I still want to do my best to complete this project.\n\nThank you all for your help!",

If you're using pure PyTorch, then, for example, if you have a `Model`, and it has `component1` you want to run on your fastest GPU, and `component2` on your second fastest GPU, you'd do something like\n\n```\nmodel = ...\nmodel.component1 = model.component1.to(\"cuda:0\")\nmodel.component2 = model.component2.to(\"cuda:1\")\n```\n\nBut obviously there's much more you can do and you should read the documentation surrounding this.

        "They only need to map things if they want to specifically put certain tensors/layers on specific GPUs (model parallelism). If they don't care about that, they can just use DataParallelism or DistributeDataParallelism and let PyTorch handle multi-GPU environment. Model Parallelism would mostly be seen if trying to work around memory limitations or if using different GPUs where one is stronger than the other so you put the hungrier layers on the stronger GPU. Otherwise, just Data Parallelism or DDP is all that's needed. Data Parallelism only requires like 2-3 lines of code, while DDO requires being somewhat knowledgeable on multiprocessing and requires a bit more lines of code, but fundamentally the same as Data Parallelism. Model Parallelism, like in your example, wouldn't be the first choice I would consider when someone asks about using a multi-GPU setup. Otherwise, unless they're using different GPUs, this just creates unnecessary overhead with constantly moving data from one GPU to another when you can just have each GPU handle their own share of data with the entire model on each GPU. And even if using different GPUs, depending on the specific GPUs, Model Parallelism would still be less efficient than just doing Data Parallelism.",
        "Look into Data Parallelism and Distributed Data Parallelism. Those will most likely be what you're looking for. The comment you replied to is showing Model Parallelism, which is only really necessary if you're using *different* GPUs, or if you really just want to put specific layers/tensors or a specific GPU. But if you're using multiple of the same GPU, then Model Parallelism will introduce unnecessary overhead because you'll be constantly moving data from one GPU to the other when each GPU could just be working on their own subset of the dataset and each GPU would have their own, full copy of their model to work on.\n\nAlso what do you mean by models that require more memory? Is the model itself large? Or is it just large during training? (Such as calculating the output between layers with respect to the dataset/batch). Because a 20mb image classifier can easily require 40gb+ of memory when training because of the size of a sample, the batch size, and the architecture of the model, but the model itself is just 20mb.",
        "What DataParallel does under the hood is precisely this. I have not said to build model parallel models, because these really just works for ensembles and similar architectures. \n\n\n\n\nI have only outlied the simplest way to dedicate which hardware a piece of code is ran on, and it's up to OP to determine what they actually need and what to read on later.",
        "DataParallel doesn't do what Model Parallelism does under the hood. DataParallel gives all GPUs used a copy of the original model and a unique subset of the dataset. It then trains each model separately, and then averages the weights, essentially doing federated learning but completely local and on a single dataset. DataParallel *does not* assign model components to a GPU like you have in your example. Each GPU gets the entire starting model per epoch.\n\nDataParallel does not do *model.component.to(gpu_n)*, it does *model.to(gpu_n)* at the start of each epoch. The difference is there is no communication between GPUs in an epoch like how *model.component.to(gpu_n)* would.\n\nWhether or not the model is an ensemble is irrelevant to using model parallelism or data parallelism. Model parallelism is about resource management.\n\n>I have not said to build model parallel models\n\nYou may not have explicitly said this, but your example is precisely model parallelism.",

Do you think people don't understand the concept of pseudocode?\n\n>It's the simplest example that demonstrates how to assign modules to a different device.\n\n***This is the definition of model parallelism*** since you're assigning components of the model to specific GPUs. DataParallel *does not* concern itself with model components, only the model as a whole. Even if you had an ensemble model, it would not copy sub-models to specific GPUs. It would give each GPU a copy of the entire ensemble model.\n\n>I'm not sure why you're trying to cherry pick my answer\n\nI'm not cherry picking your answer. My first comment was that model parallelism is not a starting point for someone trying to use a multi-GPU setup. Then you said DataParallel is  doing that under the hood, which is objectively false and if you look at the source code, you'd see that that's not how DataParallel works. At all.\n\n>I simply provided an answer that does what OP asked for with the context he gave.\n\nWith the context he gave, the better solution to start is DataParallel. Model Parallelism is strictly about resource management, not distributed or parallel training.\n\nOP asked about running models that require higher memory, and you responded with assigning components of the model to specific GPUs. You're telling OP to use model parallelism when that's not the solution. By fundamental nature, DataParallel uses (model_weights_size + dataset_size/n) the amount of memory where *n* is the number of GPUs, as opposed to a single GPU which uses (model_weights_size + dataset_size).\n\nYou are giving OP information about something irrelevant to their question while also clearly showing a lack of understanding on how specifically model parallelism or data parallelism work. You said DataParallel does model parallelism under the hood which is 100% false. Model components are not assigned to a specific GPU when doing DataParallel. If that were the case, the DDP would make no sense, since it's an extension of the logic behind DataParallel and the GPUs don't communicate with each other. So how would they have specific components on specific GPUs to train if they don't communicate?",
        "> That's...what I said. The difference is DataParallel works with the full model, not with components of the model.\n\n\nThat is what I said before you repeated. That's why I gave the more flexible solution, as Op didn't tell me the amount of models he would run.\n\n\n> If you look at Model Parallelism in PyTorch's documentation, it specifically talks about putting specific model components on specific GPUs.\n\n\nWhy would I? You're the only one eho is talking about model parallelism, even after admitting I never explicitly mentioned it, and even now when I said I never implicitly mentioned it. I never mentioned any paradigm related to parallelism.\n\n\n> This is a prime example of model parallelism. I'm unsure what you believe model parallelism to be, but when you're assigning model components to a specific GPU, as in the example you gave, this is model parallelism.\n\n\nNo, it is not. It is not an example of any kind of paradigm. This is an example of mapping 2 modules to two different cuda devices that for some reason you are insisting is model parallelism even after saying yourself that I never mentioned it.\n\n\n> I'm not cherry picking your answer. My first comment was that model parallelism is not a starting point for someone trying to use a multi-GPU setup.\n\n\nAlright, let me then illustrate it more clearly.\n\n\nFirstly, this is primarily a [definist fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definist_fallacy): your definition of what I said is motivated by a biased view, rather than what I actually said, which is then followed up by several [strawmen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man), where you refuse to accept that, due to the discrepancies of what I said and what you insist I have said, you are trying to argue with me about a topic I am not arguing about and about which there is nothing to argue.\n\n\nThen you follow it up with [cherry picking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_picking) on specific examples such as documentation for the strawman that you justified with a definist fallacy, and finally you top it off with either a straight up lie that it doesn't work in the manner described, or yet another fallacy, the [continuum fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorites_paradox#Continuum_fallacy)\n\n\nThe matter of the fact is that there is nothing to discuss until you acknowledge the following:\n\n\n- I never, implicitly or explicitly, mentioned any kind of parallelism, let alone model parallelism\n- I never, explicitly or implicitly, gave a solution that alludes to or is inseparably a part of any concept of parallelism, let alone model parallelism\n- it is necessary to avoid using informal fallacies to justify a position within a conversation\n\n\nAlthough, it's foreseable that in acknowleding these, there will also be nothing to discuss, because you would get rid of the motive to engage on this conversation.\n\n\n> OP asked about running models that require higher memory\n\n\nTo conclude this ridiculous argument, which is yet another straw man, I will simply quote what OP said:\n\n\n> Hi,\n\n> I was wondering how do I connect two or more GPU for neural network training. I have consumer level graphics card such as (GTX AND RTX) and would like to combine them for training purposes.\n\n> Do I have to setup cluster for GPU? Are there any guidelines for the configurations?\n\n---\n\n> I want to use PyTorch or TF and do some fine-tuning or running some models that require higher VRAM.\n\n---\n\nFrom that it should be obvious why I wouldn't even mention concepts of parallelism when OP wanted to, presumably, use multiple devices to run a model with VRAM requirements that exceed one device. This is not something solvable with data parallel, but it is not specific enough to give a full solution. With the information given, all you can basically do, without making a biased assumption, is show someone how to map a module onto a specific device, and direct them further so they can read for themselves on how to do what they want to do.",
        ">even after admitting I never explicitly mentioned it, and even now when I said I never implicitly mentioned it. I never mentioned any paradigm related to parallelism.\n\nYour comment showing model.component.to() is model parallelism. So you can read that I said you didn't explicitly say model parallelism but you apparently conveniently skipped over where I then said your example is the prime example of model parallelism. Interesting.\n\n>This is an example of mapping 2 modules to two different cuda devices that for some reason you are insisting is model parallelism even after saying yourself that I never mentioned it.\n\nOk, I'm just going to assume English isn't your first or second language and you can't understand plain English. Even the PyTorch documentation explaining model parallelism is how your example is shown. Unless you're going to sit there and say the PyTorch devs don't know what they're talking about?\n\n>I never, implicitly or explicitly, mentioned any kind of parallelism, let alone model parallelism\n\nImplicitly, yes you did. But you apparently don't know what model parallelism is, which is understandable based on what you're saying.\n\nThe fact you singled out \"parallelism\" shows you don't actually understand the difference in model parallelism and data parallelism. Model parallelism has functionally nothing to do with parallelism lol. It's just a name derived from Data Parallelism because that was the original concept.\n\nLike, if you didn't know what it was, you could've just said that but you'd rather double down on your stance when you clearly had no idea what you were even talking about. \"Mentioned any kind of parallelism\" lmaoooo that just shows you didn't know what model parallelism was. You just wanted to argue back and not admit you were misinformed. There is literally nothing about parallelism involved with model parallelism aside from the name. It's functionality is about placing model components on specific GPUs.\n\nI'm glad you said that because like a typical redditor, you argue something you don't understand and then scream \"fallacy\" when it's evident that you don't actually understand what you're talking about.\n\nSay it with me: model parallelism has nothing to do with parallelism - it's just in the name.\n\n>I never, explicitly or implicitly, gave a solution that alludes to or is inseparably a part of any concept of parallelism, let alone model parallelism\n\nYes you did. You clearly didn't know that model parallelism doesn't have anything to do with the functionality of parallelism.\n\n>it is necessary to avoid using informal fallacies to justify a position within a conversation\n\nIt is necessary to know what you're talking about when trying to argue a stance instead of doubling down against something that is common knowledge with deep learning libraries.\n\nLol when you don't know what you're talking about so you try to be like any typical redditor and try to cite fallacies. Then you're using them incorrectly.\n\n>This is not something solvable with data parallel\n\nYes it is.\n\n>is show someone how to map a module onto a specific device\n\nIt's like talking to a brick wall. How is it so difficult for you to understand that \"mapping a module onto a specific device\" ***is the definition of model parallelism***? Is the word \"parallelism\" throwing you off? Model parallelism has nothing to do with parallel processing, it's just a name, while Data Parallelism *does* deal with parallel processing.\n\nYou keep saying you never implicitly mentioned model parallelism yet you literally did. What you're doing is like saying \"this is a contraption with four wheels, it moves using a combustion engine connected to a transmission/drive train, someone can sit inside, start and stop the contraption and also control its movements, but I'm not implicitly describing a vehicle\" or \"this food item consists of a sesame seed bun sliced in half horizontally, and it contains a beef patty, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and pickles between the buns, but I'm not implicitly describing a burger.\"\n\nEver heard the phrase if it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck...? You don't have to explicitly say it's a duck to understand it's a duck. You described model parallelism in all forms except explicitly using the words \"model parallelism.\" You're trying to base your stance on \"since I didn't say model parallelism, it's not model parallelism.\"\n\nYou either don't know what you're talking about, unnecessarily contrarian and argumentative, or trolling. I wouldn't be surprised if you never took a look at the documentation on model parallelism because it's exactly what you described: placing components of models on specific GPUs.",

The [dataset ](https://datasetninja.com/remote-sensing-land-cover-dataset)consists of **7 classes** (background, building, road, water, barren, agriculture, and forest). However, I’ve noticed that my model is consistently **overfitting** to one particular class (*Forest*), while performing quite well in all the other classes (except class *Barren*, which is difficult to predict for the [authors ](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=bLBIbVaGDu)of the dataset as well).\n\n# My attempts\n\nI’ve tried several approaches to handle this issue, including:\n\n* Class weighting to balance the loss function\\* based on the pixel distribution per class.\n* Data augmentation to increase the variety in the training set.\n* Early stopping to avoid overfitting in general.\n* Learning rate scheduling (I’m currently using `ReduceLROnPlateau`).\n* L2 Regularization in Conv2D Layers.\n\n# Loss function\n\nThe utilized loss function is:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/corzxzeoi3vd1.png?width=563&format=png&auto=webp&s=a473554a42023d2d6f6f097b8c3266bb0e9f358c\n\nwhere **L\\_cce** is the categorical cross-entropy over all the classes, **L\\_bce** is the binary crossentropy or the single class *Background*, and **L\\_FTL** is the weighted Focal Tvesky Loss.\n\n# Model architecture\n\nI am currently using a UNet model with pre-trained Resnet50 backbone, which is trainable in the last 30% of layers, and non-trainable in the first 70%.

        ">However, I’ve noticed that my model is consistently overfitting to one particular class\n\nThat's not what overfitting is. Overfitting isn't related to classes the model trains on. Overfitting is about the model's performance on the train set with respect to the test set. It sounds like what you're talking about is bias. Bias is not overfitting. For instance, if you're training a binary classifier on a dataset with two classes (A and B) and 80% of the dataset is ClassA, then the model will be biased towards classifying ClassA since that will always give at least 80% accuracy when randomly guessing.\n\n>I’ve tried several approaches to handle this issue, including:.\n\nOf this list, the only thing that will address an imbalanced dataset is Class Weighting and possibly data augmentation, but with augmentation, you'd need to first establish class weights, so the only real contributor is class weighting. Everything else is something used to address overfitting, which, according to the problem you've described, ***is not the issue***. Firstly, stop doing extra things that are irrelevant to the issue. If you set the class weights appropriately, then with each batch, you should have roughly 1/n proportion of samples from each class, where *n* is the number of classes. Then, if your model is still not giving good classification metrics, check the loss over time. If loss is decreasing over time, you most likely need to increase the training length.\n\n>Early stopping to avoid overfitting in general.\n\nThis will hurt your performance more than help. So far, you haven't given any reason to suspect you're overfitting. Overfitting means your model is performing well over the entirety of the train set, while not performing nearly as well over the entirety of the test set. You likely need the model to train much longer than you currently haven't sent to. EarlyStopping is only really relevant to use if you know the model will likely have very good accuracy and loss metrics on an epoch that's less than the total number of epochs that you selected as a hyperparameter. Basically, remove this.\n\n>Learning rate scheduling (I’m currently using ReduceLROnPlateau).\n\nDon't use this. There's no reason to use this because of an imbalanced dataset. This is used when the decrease in loss has stagnated/plateaued. Even if you were overfitting, this isn't something that addresses overfitting. Remove this.\n\n>L2 Regularization in Conv2D Layers.\n\nRemove this. Unless there's a reason to have L2, this is an unnecessary addition that can cause poor training for no reason. If you want some kind of in-layer processing of the tensors, use BatchNorm, but even then, don't add that unless you find there's a reason to.\n\n>where L_cce is the categorical cross-entropy over all the classes, L_bce is the binary crossentropy or the single class Background, and L_FTL is the weighted Focal Tvesky Loss.\n\nWhy are you using binary cross entropy? \"Background\" is its own class and it's not a special class. Start minimal and add to it when you believe the additions will help. Occam's Razor tells us not to multiply unnecessary factors, and to try to remain as minimal as necessary to find the solution. This *very much* applies to deep learning, where deep learning is a highly chaotic system.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any reason why you wouldn't just use categorical cross entropy loss, or just plain cross entropy loss. If you're using class weights, why are you then using Focal Tvesky loss? FC loss is meant for a dataset where the inputs to the model are imbalanced. If you're using class weights, the inputs are balanced. Just use cross entropy loss.\n\n>I am currently using a UNet model with pre-trained Resnet50 backbone, which is trainable in the last 30% of layers, and non-trainable in the first 70%\n\nWhy are you using resnet? The classes you're training on aren't even part of resnet, so you'd essentially just be using the architecture, no? Resnet is a deep and robust model architecture that is so because it's trained on 1000 classes. You're only working with seven, so you very much likely don't need a model that deep. Start with a smaller model and add layers as needed. Having a deep model doesn't help just because it's deep. An unnecessarily deep model will very often lead to no learning occuring because the model can't adjust its weights at a good enough rate to facilitate any actual learning. You want a model that's not too deep so weights can easily change as required.\n\n>One additional idea I think I will develop is a separated model for Forest class prediction only, and then combine it with the overall model somehow.\n\nThat would fundamentally be the same as if you had the current multiclass classifier working, because the only difference is you're then using a model that does [everything - Forest] + [Forest] which then becomes [everything].\n\nI don't mean to sound cold, but it seems like you could learn more about how deep learning models work and how different components (algorithms) affect the model's performance. It also seems like you're just trying different things and hoping it works without understanding what exactly those different things are and why they would be used.",
        "First thing first, thanks a lot for your answer. It really means a lot to me.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n>You likely need the model to train much longer than you currently haven't sent to. EarlyStopping is only really relevant to use if you know the model will likely have very good accuracy and loss metrics on an epoch that's less than the total number of epochs that you selected as a hyperparameter.\n\nI first trained my models without Early Stopping, but I noticed that it plateaued usually around epoch 60, so for time efficiency I decided to include it. However, I will train models without Early Stopping following your advice.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n>Don't use this. There's no reason to use this because of an imbalanced dataset. This is used when the decrease in loss has stagnated/plateaued.\n\nI introduced ReduceLROnPlateau because I noticed a flattening behavior of the loss around epoch 60. My bad, I forgot to mention that I did face stagnation, and it was not related to overfitting, rather a general info about the workflow.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n>Remove this. Unless there's a reason to have L2, this is an unnecessary addition that can cause poor training for no reason.\n\nYeah, this is nonsense in my case. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n>Why are you using binary cross entropy?\n\nI am following the implementation details of the authors, who crafted their own loss function. It is the loss function I got inspired from, and I basically replaced the original Dice with my Focal Tversky Loss, with the aim to focus on hard-to-classify examples. Again, my bad because I didn't provide the reasoning behind the loss function. However, I will make experiments using a simple categorical crossentropy loss. Thanks for the tip.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n>The classes you're training on aren't even part of resnet, so you'd essentially just be using the architecture, no?\n\nExactly, I wanted to leverage the power of an already setup architecture which is well known for its efficacy. I followed [this tutorial](https://keras.io/guides/transfer_learning/).\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n>That would fundamentally be the same as if you had the current multiclass classifier working, because the only difference is you're then using a model that does \\[everything - Forest\\] + \\[Forest\\] which then becomes \\[everything\\]\n\nI admit that this was a meaningless idea. Indeed it provided poor results.\n\n>  \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n>I don't mean to sound cold, but it seems like you could learn more about how deep learning models work and how different components (algorithms) affect the model's performance.\n\nI appreciate your honesty and I acknowledge that you are completely spot on. I am new in this field and this post let me understand that I should go deeper into the theory. Thank you again",
        "Depending on the complexity of your dataset and also model, it's very possible that you're seeing stagnation and plateaus but it's just a brief period of it. For example, I have some IoT network anomaly classifiers that I have to train on about 20,000 epochs. If I used something to stop training when loss appeared to stop decreasing or to adjust the learning rate similarly, either training would've stopped around the 100-2000 epoch range, and learning rate would be changed so often, and decreased so much that the update step of backpropagation would have very, very little changes. Loss stagnation would be something that's seen over quite a significant portion of epochs with respect to the total number of epochs. Unless the dataset is fairly simple with easy to distinguish classes, I wouldn't expect double digit or even triple digit total epochs to be good enough.\n\nA lot of time, people watch accuracy as if that's the golden metric for classifiers, but loss will tell you so much more about the training performance. If you simplify your model, give it a longer training period (I would say starting at around 1000 epochs to give a good visual pattern), and notice that loss is decreasing over time, no matter how small, then your model is learning and will have good performance. It just needs time.\n\nThe issue with trying to use an already-established architecture is that you essentially need to use that model's weights if you want to actually use its performance. Otherwise, you're just using its architecture, which you can build yourself really. And since you're only working with seven classes, the depth of resnet would honestly be way too much. I would suggest trying with just a few CNN layers and see how that works, and adding additional layers as needed. Jumping straight to resnet for a seven-class problem seems like it would cause more headache than anything.\n\nHopefully this doesn't sound discouraging. There is definitely quite a bit of a learning curve, but once you get it, it'll become second nature, then you'll look back on your previous attempts and see how much of a difference your deep learning approaches are and the amount of knowledge you gained :)",

    "selftext": "I am planning to build a PC for Machine Learning. There is no budget limit. This will be my first time building a PC. I have researched what kind of specifications are required for Machine Learning. But it is still confusing me. I have researched quite a bit about the parts, but it does not seem as simple as building a gaming PC. Also, there aren't many resources available compared to gaming PC. Which is why i turned to this subreddit for guidance.\n\nI wanted to know what options are available and what things I should keep in mind while choosing the parts. Also, if you had to build one (your dream workstation), what parts would you choose, given that there is no budget limit.\n\n  \nEdit: I didn't want to give a budget because I was okay with spending as much as I wanted. But I can see many people suggesting to give a budget because the upper limit can go as much as I want. Therefore, if I were forced to give a budget, it would be 40k USD. I am okay with extending the budget as long as the price-to-performance ratio is good. I will also be okay with going to a lower budget if the price-to-performance ratio justifies it. \n\nEdit: No, I don't wanna build a server. I need a personal computer that can sit on my desk without requiring a special power supply line, and I can watch YouTube videos during my spare time when my model is training.\n\nEdit: Many suggest getting the highest-priced pre-built PC if budget is not an issue. But I don't want that. I want to build it myself. I want to go through the hassle of selecting the parts myself, so that in the process i can learn about them.",

        "If budget is not an issue, just use literally any build with a text editor, and rent compute on Colab/etc.\n\nIf you're training NNs/LLMs, nothing on your desktop is gonna approach the speed/size/convenience of a dedicated compute cluster, and you might as well just get a decent budget PC and do your training online.\n\nIf you're doing more traditional statistical ML, then any budget PC is enough to run what you need off of sklearn.\n\nSource: currently doing my masters in NLP, and some of my classmates are using 12 year old brick laptops with no issues.",
        "Ok, here is the answer: AsusPro WS WRX90E-SAGE SE, Threadripper PRO 7995WX, 512GB ECC DDR5, 4 x RTX 6000 ADA, 1500w PSU, Case: Phanteks Enthoo Pro II SE",

        "The most important thing to keep in mind is GPU VRAM it must be as high as possible, so you could go with one RTX 4090/3090, two if your budget allows it, also you should get a decent amount of RAM 64 GB is good. The rest doesn't matter that much.",
        "Given budget is not a concern and you are brand new, go out and buy a normal gaming PC. Spin up a vm in azure or aws and poke around from there. They will have a capable machine at the right cost, but there's a very good chance you don't need 8x h100 gpus while learning, so this let's you learn what you actually need for your use case. You'll most likely be able to run it on a standard desktop with 3080 or better gpu. If you are utilizing 100% of the h100s, there's some beefy workstations that can be built on epyc systems with 4 dual slot gpus that i would shoot for. 15k a pop and another 40k per h100. But if it's needed, it's needed.\n\nEdit: the heat will also be a major concern. If you are running 1-1.3kw 24/7, the room will net very hot without additional air movement in and out of the room. Source: i ran a gpu mining farm in my apartment.",
        "Got it! So, you’re looking to build a beast of a machine for machine learning (ML), with a budget of around $40K but willing to adjust based on value. Here’s what you should focus on:\n\n1. GPU (Graphics Card): This is \\*the\\* most critical part for ML. Look at NVIDIA GPUs, especially from the RTX 4090\\*or A100 series. You could even go with multiple GPUs if you want serious power for parallel processing.\n\n2. CPU (Processor): While ML is more GPU-heavy, a strong CPU will still help. Think AMD Threadripper or Intel i9 13900K—these are top-tier and will make sure your system runs smoothly.\n\n3. RAM (Memory): You'll need lots of RAM for ML. Aim for at least 128GB to 256GB. More complex models or datasets might need even more.\n\n4. Storage: Fast storage helps with handling large datasets. Go for NVMe SSDs (like the Samsung 990 Pro). Maybe around 4TB+.\n\n5. Cooling: With such powerful parts, you’ll want to keep things cool. Liquid cooling systems (like Corsair iCUE) are great for this.\n\n6. Motherboard: Make sure the motherboard supports all these parts. ASUS ROG or MSI MEG are solid picks.\n\n7. Power Supply: You’ll need a strong one, something like 1200W or higher from a trusted brand like EVGA.\n\n8. Case: A big case to fit everything, with good airflow. Check out Fractal Design or Lian Li.\n\nIf I had to build my dream ML workstation, I'd go for a setup like this—no server, just a monster desktop. And yep, you'll totally learn a ton by picking the parts yourself!",
        "If you have several tens of thousands of dollars to spend, you can take some inspiration from these builds: https://lambdalabs.com/gpu-workstations/vector-pro\n\nNot affiliated, don't know whether the company or pricing is any good, but the workstations specs are pretty insane.",
        "I just built this. \nGet the ProArt 870e motherboard which just came out and stick with two 4090s if you don't care about cost. I made a last minute change to use a used 3090 so I could go with 5090 when they come available in February. \n\nOther than that you should be good and under 7k\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/PcBuild/s/XZlFCDPQwG",
        "Look up a Puget Systems machine and base your build on that?\n\nPCI-E lanes, power, cooling, noise, and space are the constraints of note (other than price) for a machine you will have on your desk.\n\nYou will want to figure out which are the high-amperage power circuits in your house. A 15A circuit is likely to flip the breaker.\n\nLook at e.g. ASUS WRX90 motherboard. Lots of ML builds are based on that as it provides ample PCI-E lanes to support many GPUs.\n\nCome hang out at r/threadripper and you'll find a lot of folks building similar machines, including myself.\n\nSystem memory and GPU memory are other key considerations. You can get a lot more GPU / $ if you don't need to hold large models in memory.\n\nRTX 6000 (older generation), RTX 6000 Ada (current generation), A100, H100 are cards that are 2x PCI-E slots wide so you could fit 4x of them on a WRX90. You could do a 4x RTX 6000 Ada build under $40k. RTX 6000 (NOT Ada) would be the budget version of this. 350W power draw x4 is 1400W, plus the draw of mobo, CPU, and other components, a single 1600W PSU can't handle them at full power draw. You would need to programmatically limit the GPU and/or CPU power usage to fit the power envelope, or just do 2x or 3x GPUs. Or if you can get an over-1600W PSU then you have more headroom, but I found those hard to come by, at least any that seemed safe. (Unless you are on 240V - in that case you should have options.) The other option is to run multiple power supplies, connected to different circuits.\n\nAir cooling vs. water cooling: my experience with the RTX 6000 Ada is that it air-cools well. But you do see multi-GPU builds in r/watercooling.\n\nCase: as big as you dare to have sitting in your house. Extra room if you water cool. Some facilitate multiple PSUs. Definitely measure and visualize the thing before ordering!\n\nA machine like this generates a lot of heat, even at idle. You should either have air conditioning, or some plan for airflow away from the computer.",

And you can always set up remote server if your needs exceed your resources.\nHeck, even I use a PC with low ball 3050 with 8 GB of VRAM at work for prototyping as it is not loud and meets my basic needs.

Machine learning is just a fundamentally different use case than watching videos or playing games.\n\nIt would make more sense to have dedicated machines for each use case. I would pay a cloud server to run my model training and buy a workstation for working/gaming/streaming.

The device is designed to be small and non-intrusive, so it doesn’t interfere with  or bias the movements being tracked.\n\nThe main idea is to use it as a **data collector**, with motion data being **labeled and transmitted in real time**, making it easy to integrate into various projects (think: fitness, sports, healthcare, robotics, etc.). the device will also be able to deploy its own classification model.\n\nI'm looking for some feedback and suggestions from people who have worked on similar projects or have experience with motion sensors, IoT devices, or real-time data collection. Specifically:\n\n* **What additional features** would be useful to include in a device like this?\n* Are there any **specific use cases** I should consider that would benefit from real-time, labeled motion data?\n* Any thoughts on how to improve the **user experience** for developers or end-users? We aren't going to offer any front, but the device will be programable with python.\n\nThanks in advance for your insights",

    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI’ve been building a Bayesian neural network using TensorFlow Probability, replacing Dense layers with DenseVariational layers.\n\nWhen I train the model on a relatively large dataset (20k rows, 60 columns), my regular neural network (25,25,25 architecture) manages to achieve a MAPE of 6%. However, my Bayesian neural network (with a smaller 12,12,12 architecture) is stuck at a MAPE of 90%. I used fewer units in the Bayesian model since its computational time increases significantly, and adding more units doesn’t seem to help it break out of this performance plateau.\n\nHas anyone faced similar issues with TensorFlow Probability? Any suggestions on how to improve the Bayesian network’s performance to match traditional neural networks would be really appreciated!\n\nThanks!",

I did not receive any scientific research training during my undergraduate studies, and my supervisor did not give me any clear guidance. It seems that I can only rely on myself to publish papers. Although I have collected some information on the Internet, I still do not understand the true meaning of scientific research. It may be because I am used to exam-oriented education and those routine questions, and I have not figured out the \"routine\" of scientific research. My current situation is that I have read more than a dozen papers in the field, and I have had some understanding of this field and its problems.But there are few top conference papers of my research direction every year. In the past few years, there are even only one or two papers in all top conferences combined.I feel a little bit that it has been done to the extent that it has been done..(by the way, my research field is few-shot object detection).\n\nMy current problem is that I don’t know how to come up with valuable ideas. I would like to ask you talented guys if you can give me some advice, and I will be very appreciated of that!!There are really not many papers in the top conferences in my field, and I feel that many papers solve different sub-problems in this field. So can I learn from related fields? If I can learn from them, can I move them directly? If not, I need to modify them, how can I start with it?The reason why I think about it is that I find many top conference papers refer to methods of other fields. Since I am a novice in scientific research, I am really at a loss as to how to proceed. Moreover, I also want to ask that will deep learning research become much easier once a person gets started? As the number of papers I read increases, will there be a steady stream of ideas?",

It would take too long to give an informative reply, however people have been using deep learning to calculate prices more quickly, for situations where accurate pricing takes a long time, or to speed up model calibration, either by speeding up the pricing itself, or by using DL to infer the model parameters from traded option prices.\n\nAnother potential application is for trades like Bermudan swaptions, for which traditional models calibrated to vanillas struggle to calculate accurate prices, or are slow, or not sufficiently accurate. For callable products in general, which are often priced by Longstaff-Schwartz, the latter involves a linear regression to calculate, at each MC step, the continuation value, i.e. the value of the option if it is not exercised at that time. This regression can be replaced by DL. \n\nApart from option pricing, potential applications of DL also include interpolating implied vols or calculating proxy vol surfaces for illiquid assets.",

These odds are likely the best indicators of a bet's potential profitability. For simplicity, my input is a tensor of shape `[3 x 6]`, representing the home win, draw, and away win odds from six different bookmakers.\n\n**Ground Truth:**\n\nI'm using the profit from a bet as the ground truth. For example, if the odds are `[2.1, 3.3, 2.3]` and the home team wins, the ground truth vector would be `[2.1, 0, 0]`.\n\n**Data:**\n\nI have collected betting odds and match outcomes from the past 24 seasons, sourced from [football-data.co.uk](https://www.football-data.co.uk/data.php).\n\n**Model:**\n\nAs a beginner, I started with a simple neural network model:\n\n    class BetMaster(nn.Module):\n        def __init__(self, len_providers, hidden_size):\n            super().__init__()\n            self.layer_1 = nn.Linear(3 * len_providers, hidden_size)\n            self.layer_2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size * 2)\n            self.layer_3 = nn.Linear(hidden_size * 2, hidden_size)\n            self.layer_4 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 3)\n    \n        def forward(self, X):\n            batch_size = X.size(0)\n            X = self.layer_1(X.view(batch_size, -1))\n            X = torch.relu(X)\n            X = self.layer_2(X)\n            X = torch.relu(X)\n            X = self.layer_3(X)\n            X = torch.relu(X)\n            X = self.layer_4(X)\n            return X.view(batch_size, 3)\n\n**Results:**\n\nI've experimented with various loss functions and ground truths, but none have yielded consistent profits. Occasionally, I achieved profits between €0 and €200 on the validation set, which averages out to a mere €0.01 profit per bet and isn't consistent across different games.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* **Approach:** Does anyone have suggestions on better ways to tackle this problem?\n* **Model Architecture:** Is there a more suitable model architecture for predicting betting profitability?\n* **Loss Function/Optimizer:** What loss functions or optimizers would you recommend for this task?\n\nAny help or insights would be greatly appreciated!",

        "I am a Chemistry Phd in US so my response is biased. Here is my honest opinion  \n  \nResearch position without PhD is extremly difficult and unlikely because PhD is where you can get proper training on doing research.   \n  \nYou are obviously a smart person but I do not trust you on carrying out a research on your own, mainly because you do not have paper publication in your portfolio. Here are some problems that I can think of,\n\n1. Large gap between your portfolio & AI alignment or LLMs\n\n2. Your portfolio focuses heavily on fast prototyping a model, but these are not directly related to research. Implementing the Attention paper is a good practice but people can still argue that this is \"following the recipe\", not research\n\n3. You can only learn so much in a short term project. Good research techniques are developed over time. It is better if you can have a project that has more depth \n\n4. You do not have a niche right now. \n\nI think you can land a research position some day, but it takes preparation. I suggest you to prioritize on finding a job position that can be mentored(ideally by a phd) If possible, try to publish a paper in a company first.  Also, you can try to do some kaggle competition. kaggle is a good practice for research, some kagglers even end up publishing their results as papers. good luck!",

It's not an empirical research paper but more about a theoretical one. I might pursue a PhD if I get a scholarship (which I'm currently preparing for an exam for). Do you think that'll be enough? I do say about a research position but it's for a research position like in a company like Anthropic or Inflection, mostly for Alignment Science research. Their job description highlights that \" Candidates need not have:\n100% of the skills needed to perform the job.\nFormal certifications or education credentials\"\nSo that's why I was wondering",
        "That is great, I think a theoretical paper is beneficial to you because you already have lots of startup experience(even if it is just an arxiv draft), but you need to find a way to sell you research paper such that the company you are interested in are convinced that you are the right guy for the job, if that makes sense.\n\nWhether this is enough is up to the market. I cannot set a bar for you because the bar change all the time. The best I can advice you is to stay updated to the tech market, but from what I know so far, the job market is pretty bad now.(This is why I decide stay in academia for now btw). If you want real information, just send your cv to those company and you will know the real situation about the market.\n\nThe \"Candidates need not have: 100% of the skills needed to perform the job. Formal certifications or education credentials\"  is a typical strategy for startups or big tech companies because they want to reach extremely driven and smart people who doesn't care about any paper/degree etc. The problem is how do you stand out? Do you know have any real innovative idea on alignment etc. Because if you cannot convince them with anything than probably you won't produce anything even if they throw you with money. \n\nI hope this help. It is good to have high goals but your plan need to be realistic and accurate. Cheers.",

I would like to avoid having to retrain or finetune the model to better handle images directly from the camera stream. One solution I see is to simply reproduce the jpg artifacts during inference by writing the image to a jpg file and then reload it into memory (maybe there's a library that does this without the overhead of actually writing to file?).

If you want to really upgrade, you might be looking at the 4090, or even the 3090, both @ 24GB.

As a simple metric using computer vision, I would consider 8GB the absolute minimum to process an HD image, while 12 GB makes this much more comfortable, and at 16GB you can start to consider larger images, or significantly more complex networks.",
        "In my view, \"Can it fit the model in VRAM?\" is more important than \"It finished training 10% sooner\".\n\nAnother consideration is how many GPUs you will ultimately want. If you are content with one, then the main series such as 3090 or 4090 are a good way to go. However, the form factor usually consumes 3 PCI-E slots width, and has fans that outlet into the case rather than out the back, neither of which combines well with having a bunch of GPUs. In that case the professional series like RTX 6000 and RTX 6000 Ada are more interesting. But they cost essentially 2x on a price-per-VRAM basis, IIRC.",

The one without augmentation has 4500 audio files, one with has about 9000 files. Now the funny thing is, model can accurately predict any real audio fed to it, be it recorded from my microphone or downloaded. But when it comes to Deep Fakes, here's where my problem is. \n\n\n\n\n\nI am assuming the Text to Speech AI voices are of different technology than Voice Synthesis, is that why my model can't generalise the audio as a fake one? Though my model can easily tell which is fake and real from my dataset(I kept some fake audio files aside before training in order to keep it unseen to the model). But cannot generalise on Text to Speech data. Is there any way I can work my way around this?\n\n\n\n  \nOr is there any site for speech synthesis, so I can feed my voice and generate a clone of my voice to test this model. I emailed the owners of the dataset but did not get any response as of now. I am also open to learning new models if it means than CNN cannot work well with audio data. I appreciate every bit of help.\n\n\n\n  \nSome details of preprocessing: I did resampling, rms normalisation to keep same volume, vad, framing, windowing(Hann), stft, mel-scaling. I fed the mel-spectrograms as data to my model.(Also, while training I applied a seed, incase someone wonders why the graphs look identical.)\n\n\n\nThank you for taking the time to read!\n\n[With Augmentation](https://preview.redd.it/3pqjz51ny9ud1.png?width=1136&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffb362ac51ede32dd9215d15d82b720af67e3d66)\n\n[Without Augmentation](https://preview.redd.it/15pmwlgiy9ud1.png?width=1144&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e78c30065dd18ec3cf3267408abdcd191dffa2a)\n\n",

Subsequently, each process load the TF datasets with shuffle\\_files turned on but everyone uses the same int as a seed. Then each process is assigned a different starting point so no data is used in more than one GPU in each epoch. So the loading and shuffling is handled by tfds instead of Torch's DataLoader.\n\nI have tried wrapping the dataset in a custom Torch dataset and feed it to Torch's DataLoader but it is much slower (\\~30-40% slower). Converting and saving the datasets to a Torch-friendly format is probably going to take some time since the dataset is relatively large. In addition, this approach seems to be fast enough.

    "selftext": ">\n\nWe are a recursively self-improving system: educating ourselves makes us smarter, which then allows us to learn even more efficiently. Human civilization as a whole improves itself over longer timescales. In mechatronics, better manufacturing robots create even better manufacturing robots. Military empires expand recursively — the larger the empire, the greater its means to expand further. In personal investing, the more money you have, the more you can make.\n\nBut all these examples demonstrate that recursively self-improving systems don’t necessarily lead to an uncontrollable explosion of intelligence. They show predictable patterns of growth and improvement.\n\nConsider software development. Initially, we created compilers for automated programming. Then, using these compilers, we developed new languages with more powerful paradigms. These languages enabled advanced tools like debuggers, IDEs, linters, and bug predictors. In the future, the software may even write itself.\n\nHowever, despite this recursive self-improvement, the usefulness of software increases at a linear pace. While the number of developers and transistors (following Moore’s law) has grown exponentially, our computers are only slightly more useful now than in previous decades.\n\n**This is because the usefulness of software is limited by its application context, just as intelligence is limited by the environment in which it operates.**\n\nSoftware, like our brains, is part of a larger system. The context of our lives and economies restricts the potential usefulness of software, just as our environment limits individual intelligence, even with a superhuman brain.\n\n>**Full Article:** [**https://medium.com/aiguys/we-are-just-scaling-ai-and-not-coming-with-novel-ideas-3e2c35e5958d?sk=9230b7d1bf8989397bc2e95677471924**](https://medium.com/aiguys/we-are-just-scaling-ai-and-not-coming-with-novel-ideas-3e2c35e5958d?sk=9230b7d1bf8989397bc2e95677471924)\n\nBeyond contextual hard limits, even if one part of a system has the ability to recursively self-improve, other parts of the system will inevitably start acting as bottlenecks. Antagonistic processes will arise in response to recursive self-improvement and squash it — in software, this would be resource consumption, feature creep, and UX issues.\n\nWhen it comes to intelligence, inter-system communication arises as a brake on any improvement of underlying modules — a brain with smarter parts will have more trouble coordinating them; a society with smarter individuals will need to invest far more in networking and communication, etc.\n\nIt is perhaps not a coincidence that very high-IQ people are more likely to suffer from certain mental illnesses. It is also perhaps not random happenstance that military empires of the past have ended up collapsing after surpassing a certain size. Exponential progress meets exponential friction.\n\nOne specific example that is worth paying attention to is that of scientific progress because it is conceptually very close to intelligence itself — science, as a problem-solving system, is very close to being a runaway superhuman AI. Science is, of course, a recursively self-improving system, because scientific progress results in the development of tools that empower science — whether lab hardware (e.g. quantum physics led to lasers, which enabled a wealth of new quantum physics experiments), conceptual tools (e.g. a new theorem, a new theory), cognitive tools (e.g. mathematical notation), software tools, communications protocols that enable scientists to better collaborate (e.g. the Internet)…\n\nWe didn’t make greater progress in physics over the 1950–2000 period than we did over 1900–1950 — we did, arguably, about as well. Mathematics is not advancing significantly faster today than it did in 1920. Medical science has been making linear progress on essentially all of its metrics, for decades. And this is despite us investing exponential efforts into science — the headcount of researchers doubles roughly once every 15 to 20 years, and these researchers are using exponentially faster computers to improve their productivity.\n\nWhat we pursue and don’t pursue is fundamentally linked to human interests, thus it is possible that these systems won’t scale exponentially, because that would mean exponential resource requirements. This in itself, **along with exponential growth with exponential challenges limits the sudden explosion in Science or technology.**\n\nHere are a few examples of these systems. Importantly, every single one of them would also apply to recursively self-improving AIs.\n\nDoing science in a given field gets exponentially harder over time — the founders of the field reap most of the low-hanging fruit, and achieving comparable impact later requires exponentially more effort. No researcher will ever achieve comparable progress in information theory as Shannon did in his 1948 paper.\n\nSharing and cooperation between researchers gets exponentially more difficult as a field grows larger. It gets increasingly harder to keep up with the firehose of new publications. Remember that a network with **N** nodes has **N \\* (N — 1) / 2** edges.\n\nAs scientific knowledge expands, the time and effort that have to be invested in education and training grows, and the field of inquiry of individual researchers gets increasingly narrow.\n\n>\n\nThis quote sums up the rapid developments in AI. AI is not different from other fields. We can be certain that no exponential trend can continue indefinitely. But it can be hard to predict when a tech trend is about to plateau. This is especially so when the growth stops suddenly rather than gradually. The trendline itself contains no clue that it is about to plateau.\n\n  \nTwo famous examples are CPU clock speeds in the 2000s and airplane speeds in the 1970s. CPU manufacturers decided that further increases to clock speed were too costly and mostly pointless (since the CPU was no longer the bottleneck for overall performance), and simply decided to stop competing on this dimension, which suddenly removed the upward pressure on clock speed. With airplanes, the story is more complex but comes down to the market prioritizing [fuel](https://theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/Aircraft-fuel-burn-trends-sept2020.pdf) [efficiency](https://www.etw.de/uploads/pdfs/ATAG_Beginners_Guide_to_Aviation_Efficiency_web.pdf) over speed.",

You are contradicting yourself by saying there aren't enough novel ideas and then complaining that the field will be hard to follow if there are too many papers (a lot of which are proposing \"novel ideas\").\n\nIt's funny that someone interested in machine learning would unironically say \"high IQ people\", as if intelligence can be measured with a single value or that IQ was ever an effective way of doing so.

And if you go deeper you will realize that even the idea of attention is as old as 1991.\n\nAnother big paper was Alpha Fold, which created truly a new paradigm. Others were diffusion and GAN. And even GAN paper had its origin in the 90s. There might be a few others but the growth is definitely not exponential in terms of new ideas. I don't know much about the RL subdomain, but the rest of the field has been primarily scale-dependent.\n\nAnd your claim that I don't know anything about deep learning has no basis.

        "There a number of different ways of approaching this. Learning the math behind deep learning is certainly essential for \"mastering\" it (especially in terms of understanding and/or producing research), but I'd argue that in most cases understanding the math really doesn't provide much of a better understanding of deep learning in any material sense. This is kind of like learning how the biochemistry of a brain works in order to understand psychology. At the edge, it can be very important, but if your goal is to completely understand psychology, then you'd be dedicating your time to the wrong areas if you focused on the biochemistry.\n\nNow, to *truly* understand it from the ground up, you'd certainly need to have mastered the math behind it. But that essentially comes last on the list of things to learn. You *do* need to understand enough of the math that you understand how the code/algorithms work, but that's likely just understanding that something like gradient descent *does* work rather than \"why\" it works. This distinction is important, since understanding \"why\" something works in math is a pretty difficult boundary to set, so by only learning enough math to understand the implementation, you're avoiding the issue of falling down the math rabbit hole (or at least delaying that issue until you can truly appreciate it).\n\nSo, with all that being said, you should focus on the algorithms. You should be able to implement basic deep learning algorithms from \"scratch.\" There's a bunch of these tutorials out now, but a good place to start is the \"build neural network in X lines of code\" tutorials, [like this one](https://medium.com/technology-invention-and-more/how-to-build-a-simple-neural-network-in-9-lines-of-python-code-cc8f23647ca1). They usually come with enough math to explain what it is you're doing. You should be able to \"master\" this basic task. Like, be able to explain each component of your code and how it works, including the math, all on a whiteboard. You should also build a seriously good intuition for what it's doing. This will involve stepping through the code, iteration after iteration, and printing/displaying results, working with different examples, experimenting and verifying your hypothesis, etc.\n\nFrom there, you can dive into learning a bit more about building full networks and understanding more of the end-to-end math. Following [something like this](https://eisenjulian.github.io/deep-learning-in-100-lines/index.html) would be a good place to start. Again, you should understand each component of what you're working with, the math behind it, etc. If you don't understand something, you Google it and read about it until you do (working through plenty of examples, etc.).\n\nBeyond that, you can probably step into PyTorch and start building more complex models, etc. To continue learning, you'd probably find some research papers and work through the math/algorithms until you fully understand them (or at least understand them enough to be satisfied with your understanding).",

It can be argued that there is some job displacement involved there. But as of yet, the ROI on that sorta setup is pretty abysmal and probably wouldn't even be a thing if not for Amazon's constant influx of disposable revenue. Displacement is probably a key word there. It's more constructive to think of jobs as changing rather than being lost. And with so many resources available, such as tuition assistance, to help people learn to make AI a tool in their toolkit, these days are as good a time as any for a career refresh.

But since there are so many different variables that could impact performance (outside of hyper parameters), I want identify what works before I spend substantial time and resources training it. \n\nAlso—this will really serve as a foundation model that will continually train as new data comes in when it’s deployed.

I hope this is the right sub-reddit!\n\nI am currently working on a multi label image classification problem using ResNet152 as the backbone architecture for my CNN model, developed using Keras and TensorFlow. When training the model, I am getting a high binary accuracy score but low precision, recall and F1 scores, and the results are even poorer on the validation set: this points to the model overfitting on the training data. My dataset is quite imbalanced across the labels. I thought I could tackle this issue using a custom loss function, and in this case I have tried to use a weighted binary cross entropy loss function, feeding in the weights of each label. I have also explored over and under sampling the data, but this is proving to be a challenge as I cannot find anything that natively works with multi label datasets. I did try to modify SMOTE, but this did not do the trick. Below is an example of my data. What is the best way to deal with the poor model performance/data imbalance?

    "title": "How to finetune time series transformer hyper parameters to beat the LSTM performance?",
    "selftext": "I am trying to train an ML model on time series data. The input is 10 timeseries which are essentially a sensor data. The output is another set of three time series. I feed  the model with the window of 100. So, the input shape becomes `(100, 10)`. I want to predict output time series values for single time step. So, the output shape becomes `(1, 3)`. (If I create mini batches of size say `x`, the input and output shapes become `(x, 100, 10)` and `(x, 1, 3)`).\n\nMy approach is to first overfit the model on smaller number of records. See if model is indeed learning / able to overfit the data. Then add some regularization (mostly dropout) and then try to train the model on full dataset.\n\nFirst, I tried to overfit LSTM model on small dataset and visualised the outcome. It did well. So, I tried to train it on the whole dataset. It did okayish, but still struggled at some places. The LSTM model which I tried is as follows:\n\n    class LSTMModel(nn.Module):\n        def __init__(self, in_dim=10, hidden_size=1400, num_layers=1, output_size=3):\n            super(LSTMModelV3, self).__init__()\n    \n            self.lstm_1 = nn.LSTM(in_dim, hidden_size, num_layers, batch_first=True) \n            self.lstm_2 = nn.LSTM(hidden_size, hidden_size, num_layers, batch_first=True)\n            self.lstm_3 = nn.LSTM(hidden_size, hidden_size, num_layers, batch_first=True)\n            self.lstm_4 = nn.LSTM(hidden_size, hidden_size, num_layers, batch_first=True)\n            self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)\n    \n        def forward(self, x):\n            x, _ = self.lstm_1(x)\n            x, _ = self.lstm_2(x)\n            x, _ = self.lstm_3(x)\n            x, _ = self.lstm_4(x)\n            output = self.fc(x[:, -1, :])\n            return output\n\nI tried adding dropouts too, but it did not yield any significant improvement. So, I tried to train [PatchTST transformer model](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/patchtst). First, I tried to overfit smaller model and did well. In fact, when I visualized the output, I realised that it was able to get tighter overfit than the LSTM model. So, I tried to train it on the whole dataset. But the performance was not at all closer to LSTM.\n\nThe initial version of PatchTST I tried is as follows:\n\n    config = PatchTSTConfig(\n        num_input_channels=10,\n        context_length=100,\n        num_targets=3,\n        patch_length=10,\n        patch_stride=5,\n        prediction_length=1,\n        num_hidden_layers=5,\n        num_attention_heads=3,\n        d_model=300,\n    )\n    \n    model = PatchTSTForRegression(config)\n\nWith this as base config, I tried different changes to it for hyper parameter optimization:\n\n1. d\\_model = 600\n2. d\\_model = 800\n3. d\\_model = 600, num\\_hidden\\_layer = 7\n4. d\\_model = 600, patch\\_stride = 7\n5. d\\_model = 300, patch\\_stride = 7, num\\_hidden\\_layers = 8\n\nAnd some more combinations. These hyperparameter combinations are selected so that I can fit the model in GPU with 24GB memory. However, no configuration yield validation loss comparable to LSTM. These are the LSTM vs PatchTST curves:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4807avyucctd1.png?width=722&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf319c446c8b765aceaa0675ec044d7090073d23\n\nThe corresponding learning rate curves are as follows:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kvc9j4svcctd1.png?width=723&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ea68f35d19d4b22f77df4d8844ff5ff8edd409b\n\nI used to step down the learning rate if the performance does not improve for 7 epochs.\n\nWhat I am missing here? Do I miss any time series transformer related insight?\n\n**PS1:** Yes, the base LR starts from 0.00005, followed by step down to 0.000005, 0.0000005, 0.00000005. I know these are excessively tiny. But, in the beginning I tried to train LSTM with bigger base like 0.001, LR 0.005, 0.0005 etc, but it did not work at all. It all started working only after starting with 0.00005. May be because my sensor values themselves are very tiny.\n\n**PS2:** It might seem that the LSTM val loss has already reached near 0. But, thats only because I have higher validation loss PatchTST runs in the plot. If I remove them and add LSTM overfitting run, then it looks something like this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x3cbjwgwcctd1.png?width=686&format=png&auto=webp&s=c16625a578b766d97e508a762f5390df2dffe8cf\n\n**PS3:** I am using AdamW optimiser.\n\n**PS4:** The training loss curves look like this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a9vfa3h4mitd1.png?width=757&format=png&auto=webp&s=01fd6735fd81428fd3525466f5e7661e13a087e9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zpx1kaj4mitd1.png?width=757&format=png&auto=webp&s=e942de66f6b4d4e3fc038474b0a47fae65c031d9\n\nSo, note that the PatchTST is not even able to overfit the training data as good as LSTM. Thus, the poor validation loss performance is not due to PatchTST model is overfitting training data.\n\n**Update**\n\nI tried LSTM first with L1 loss. Then I tried vanilla transformer. But it was not overfitting small dataset. So I changed the loss function to MSE and it started reasonably overfitting. So when I tried PatchTST, I used MSE. All above PatchTST curves are with MSE loss. I switched back to L1 loss for PatchTST and first epoch loss started to close to what LSTM experienced in first epoch as can be seen in below image:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bcotske8aqwd1.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=d51ae974f0f88af5923c78ba95fb70ecd72287ea\n\nBut the PatchTST validation loss curves plateaued quickly. Rest of the data preprocessing is same for both LSTM and PatchTST.",

        "Not sure about what matrix you are referring to but for masks For a single batch of data those are already performed in parallel. All batch wise computations are done in parallel across different threads on a CPU. \n\nNow if you talk about any form of distributed training typically you launch multiple processes each now creating multiple threads that share memory to perform it's own batch calculations like for eg masking out an output tensor before gradient calculation. All of this is handled by torch/jax. \n\nIf that's your idea Torch usually already has a robust distributed training setup and then deepspeed etc build on top for more efficiency, unless there is something very specific that you are trying to accomplish that I may not be u understanding."

        "1. That's not how you calculate big O notation. You don't just add and subtract n's. For example if a program takes 100n + n/3 steps, then it is simply O(n). The magnitudes don't matter, the relationships to n matters.\n\n2. Transformers are not O(n). They are O(n^2 ). There are some that are O(n) like Linformer, but these are designed to be linear time.\n\n3. Neural networks are O(n^2 ) not O(1) lol. O(1) means no matter how big the input the execution time is the same.\n\n4. Like you mentioned, you basically have a convolutional neural network (if the weights are shared). If the weights aren't shared, then it's just a sparse MLP. Wavenet is a CNN with causal convolutions.\n\n5. It looks nothing like an RNN. I think you don't know what an RNN is. Your network is feedforward, there is nothing recurrent about it. Just because the diagram goes left to right doesn't mean anything. You can rotate the figure and it will go bottom to top. Recurrent means nodes in a layer are dependent on each other in a recurrent connection.\n\n6. Parallelizing doesn't change the complexity.. especially not to O(log n) because parallelization would be linear.",
        "I’m impressed you took the time to give such specific constructive feedback - and managed to not come off like a total asshole while doing it",
        "In general your feedback is very high quality and the author of this post should listen closely. I debated whether to make this clarification, but I think it adds to the discussion for other readers.\n\nI also read the post closely, and I think it is fair for them to say their architecture is “recurrent”. It is recurrent in a sense, as each 2 input tokens are used to generate an equivalently sized “state” embedding. Then each two state embeddings continue to be passed through the same network to generate a new state embedding. This process repeats hierarchically until that state embedding processes the information from all tokens, so at any given depth it is kind of like a bidirectional RNN that you use to just look at left-to-center and right-to-center. \n\nThis architecture is actually very similar to vanilla RNNs, such as those before LSTMs and GRUs, just with more parallelism and a less sequential order of operations. It appears upon close reading that it would be identical to a CNN, with a kernel width of 2 and a stride of 2, along with weight sharing across depth. The weights are shared across both the sequence length (like a CNN) and the depth (like a RNN), where depth is determined dynamically by the sequence length: log_2(n). \n\nThis architecture is not new, and also clearly has the same information flow problems of RNNs. For a token at the start of a sentence to influence a token at the end of a sentence there would be so, so many intermediate operations. You would hope after all that the final depth layer could still have the necessary information to consider these tokens in their very distant contexts.\n\nThe architecture would also likely have the classic problems of old RNNs before LSTMs, GRUs, etc regarding gradient problems and remembering issues, as at every depth all the information must flow through a nonlinearity.\n\nObviously I agree with most of the feedback above, I just wanted to clarify the architectural issues and why this approach is not considered anymore. We’ve seen the problems with training and using these kinds of architectures, and they are not worth the hypothetical logarithmic speed-up.",

    "selftext": "Hi,\n\nWe are two university students currently taking a course in deep learning. The goal of the course is to submit a final project. We initially thought the course would cover the topic in detail, but it turns out we need to explore and learn on our own.\n\nFor our project, we propose fine-tuning the FaceNet face recognition model for the specific task of identifying faces with sunglasses. Specifically, given one picture of person A with sunglasses and another picture of person B without sunglasses, we need to determine if A = B. We are focusing on cases where faces are looking straight at the camera.\n\nWe feel a bit lost and would greatly appreciate help with the following questions:\n\n1. We need to use \"transfer learning\", specifically by freezing most of the model's layers and training only the last few. We’re not sure how to start—do you have any suggestions for learning materials or tutorials?\n2. The deadline is roughly 1.5 months away. Has anyone done a similar project? If so, could you give us a time estimate for completing a project of this scale?\n3. In response to our proposal, the professor’s assistant suggested we try incorporating other types of obstructions, such as hats, haircuts, and beards. However, we’re struggling to find datasets for these scenarios (i.e., pairs of pictures with and without the change), any ideas of where to search?  Also, do you think this would significantly increase the workload, or would it be manageable once we’ve done the sunglasses case?\n4. We’ll likely need to use a cloud computing service for training. Are there any you would recommend? Are they easy to use?\n\nAny help is very much appreciated!\n\nLinks:\n\nWe found two possible FaceNet implementations:\n\n* [https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet)\n* [https://github.com/nyoki-mtl/keras-facenet](https://github.com/nyoki-mtl/keras-facenet)\n\nWe also found this dataset for faces with and without sunglasses:\n\n[https://github.com/cleardusk/MeGlass](https://github.com/cleardusk/MeGlass)",

        "One thing that comes to mind is using facial landmark detection datasets (see [link](https://github.com/yinguobing/facial-landmark-dataset)) to paste images of sunglasses, hats, etc. onto faces, similar to how Snapchat filters work. These images can then be used to finetune FaceNet to make it more robust to these augmentations. I'm on my phone so I won't go into too much detail, but it seems like an interesting analysis to compare model performance with and without this additional data. Feel free to DM me with additional questions!"

In that case you just send and receive request from a script using WSL to an endpoint so your local computation isn't too important.\n\nI've done dual boot and I always found that I tended to need to boot to one vs. the other more consistently and it would end up just causing me headache's having to go through the boot option upon startup (even for automatic booting as I need to do something \"special\" for booting).",

WSL + windows has a GPU overhead so you can't use the complete potential of your GPU plus other issues like driver management, if your reference code requires a particular Cuda version/driver then it becomes a huge pain. WSL for deep learning is a no-go unless you work at a beginner level at that point just use windows.",

Well simple, your company laptop will run linux. \nAnd if it's not your laptop which runs on a Linux distribution, it will be the cluster your run your jobs on, and you'll probably have to connect to it through SSH and a CLI.\n\nAbout the benefits of using Linux rather than Windows, it's just that it's more convenient. Most code written out there has been tested on Linux so you have guarantees only for this OS and not for Windows. I don't know the other specific reasons why companies tend to use Linux more than windows.\n\nAbout the benefits of a real linux environment rather than using WSL, I'd say running windows in the background takes up some ressources, which is avoided when using a Linux distribution. You also have some weird shit happening sometimes with Qt or X11 when running them inside WSL.",

So, today we are going to dive deep into music generation and look into **FluxMusic.**\n\nThe reason I want you to read this blog is that people in AI should be exposed to new ideas, outside of LLMs, I feel somehow a lot of AI engineers just don’t know enough tricks and rely too much on API calls and copying code from HuggingFace.\n\n[**Latest Developments In Music Generation**](https://medium.com/aiguys/latest-developments-in-music-generation-523b5e205b5c?sk=1b38c38c9dab783b26e34ea3d670bb4c)\n\n# AI Monthly News\n\n# OpenAI releases o1, its first model with ‘reasoning’ abilities\n\nChatGPT Plus and Team users get access to both o1-preview and o1-mini starting today, while Enterprise and Edu users will get access early next week. OpenAI says it plans to bring o1-mini access to all the free users of ChatGPT but hasn’t set a release date yet. Developer access to o1 is *really* expensive: In the API, o1-preview is $15 per 1 million input tokens, or chunks of text parsed by the model and $60 per 1 million output tokens. For comparison, GPT-4o costs $5 per 1 million input tokens and $15 per 1 million output tokens.\n\n**News article:** [**Click here**](https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242439/openai-o1-model-reasoning-strawberry-chatgpt)\n\n**o1 Model Card:** [**Click here**](https://openai.com/index/openai-o1-system-card/)\n\n# Introducing Orion, METAs First True Augmented Reality Glasses\n\nMeta recently announced a new version of its **Ray-Ban smart glasses**, integrating advanced AI features.

This includes a shift towards becoming a for-profit business and potentially raising one of the largest funding rounds in recent history, which could increase its valuation to around $150 billion. Despite this, multiple high ranking employees resigned last week, including Chief Technical Officer [Mira Murati](https://x.com/miramurati/status/1839025700009030027), Chief Research Officer [Bob McGrew](https://x.com/bobmcgrewai/status/1839099787423134051), and VP of Research [Barret Zoph](https://x.com/barret_zoph/status/1839095143397515452).

You can either use the models in Mediapipe or bring in a model from somewhere else.\n\nThen you can try to convert some PyTorch or JAX models to tensorflow.js and use it in your webapp. If you want to go the extra mile, look up what ops are available in tfjs and how to find models that can be accelerated using WebGPU. (what are ops and how are they actually implemented internally). \n\nWhile you're doing all this, you can read up about the models that you're using and how to train or fine tune them. Easiest is probably Google's Gemini nano nowadays since they're bringing it into Google chrome so it's available everywhere you have Chrome.

Basically, you spend most of your time learning theory that isn't practical, and end up wasting a lot of time.

I've been looking at papers that show results for metrics like PSNR and SSIM of SuperSlomo, Sepconv,.. etc, and these results differ completely across different papers.\n\nIn my opinion, different papers and models use different training data and training methods (hyper-parameters, augmentation, etc.). Therefore, training them again for uniformity is impossible. I tried reproducing the results using the same dataset and pretrained model they provided, but I found that the results still differed from those in the papers. I'm wondering why that is. Is it logical and ethical to use results based on what's provided in the papers?"

    "selftext": "The past two days have been a rollercoaster as I transitioned my development environment from Windows to WSL, running Ubuntu 22.04. While I’ve gained a lot from the process, it was certainly not without its struggles!\n\nThe first major hurdle was installing C++ build tools. No matter what I tried, nothing seemed to work. After extensive research and testing, I finally managed to get it up and running. But then I ran into another roadblock, Anaconda! Apparently, Anaconda doesn’t have access to files outside its environment, so I had to install build tools inside Anaconda as well. This was another time-consuming challenge, but I learned a lot through it.\n\nI tried installing llama_cpp with the conda forge channel but the version was outdated and was unuseable as some of the functions has deprecated. The workaround I did to get to install the latest version was installing gxx-compiler on anaconda using conda forge. With this, the necessary headers were added to my anaconda development environment and compilers needed were installed. This includes cmake, make, and ninja-build\n\nNext up was installing llama_cpp in my Conda environment for an application I’m building. After a lot of effort, I managed to install it, but the server kept shutting down as soon as it started. I believe this might have something to do with how Anaconda handles environments and access, but I’m still working through that part!\n\nAnd finally, Node.js... I initially tried installing it with Brew, but it wasn’t accessible from the shell. After some digging and trying different solutions, I found a GitHub script that worked perfectly, and now I’ve got Node.js up and running too.\n\nOne last thing, I’ve also installed NVIDIA drivers for WSL, allowing me to use GPU acceleration on my PC, which is a big win!\n\nIf anyone has any tips, tricks, or suggestions for working with WSL, Anaconda, or llama_cpp, I’d love to hear them. Thanks to everyone who has shared their knowledge... It’s been invaluable!\n\n#WSL #Ubuntu #Anaconda #DeepLearning #GPU #NodeJS #Python #AI #WSL2",

        "Activation functions are not necessarily „isolated” element-wise functions. It’s just any function that is applied after some layer. My interpretation is that an activation must not have trainable parameters to be considered one. Otherwise, you could call even a conv an activation function (I couldn’t find a strict definition).\n\nAs for your confusion, I don’t understand the first part of the reasoning, tbh. Softmax just takes each input and divides its exp by the sum of all inputs’ exps. The output, therefore, is three numbers representing the “probabilities” of each class (akin to how it is for single-node sigmoid but x3). And only then, as a post-processing step (”outside” in your terms), do you take the index of the highest neuron as your final prediction\n\nEdit: typos",
        "Yeah it's just a probability / confidence output.  If you yourself had 10 categories of elephant and were given a picture of an elephant, and we trying to do your job really well, you would also say that \"it's probably an African Elephant but it could be an Indian or Asian Elephant.\"  And if you were still two years old, you'd probably be less sure if you had just seen a rhinoceros and a wildebeest  \n\nAnother great resource when you're learning is \"Cross Validated\" : [https://stats.stackexchange.com/](https://stats.stackexchange.com/)\n\nGood luck!!",
        "Softmax is, imo, overused a lot. Almost all usages of multi-classification can and should just be multiple sigmoid, a class tree, etc. One of the really important to be aware of issues with softmax is that because of each output being normalized independently, its not easily justifiable to compare predictions across samples. Meaning, one class having an activation of 20%, vs another having an activation of 8%, doesn't actually mean the first image has a higher activation for that class than the second image. \n\nSo, I think its reasonable to suggest softmax isn't really an activation function, but a combination of an activation layer and a normalization layer in one.",
        "So to be specific softmax is when you want ONE class out of multiple options. If you are doing a problem where multiple classes can apply to the same input, then you don't want softmax.\n\nSoftmax takes the entire output array, and returns an array of probabilities. The reason you want it is because it takes the other inputs into consideration and \"pushes\" the largest value to the front.  \nSee this illustration:  \n[https://mriquestions.com/uploads/3/4/5/7/34572113/softmax-example\\_orig.png](https://mriquestions.com/uploads/3/4/5/7/34572113/softmax-example_orig.png)  \n3.8 is definitely larger than 1.1, but its not 15x larger. But its classification probability is 15x larger than the other class.\n\nThis forces the model to be extra decisive, which is what you want when your training data definitely has only a single label per input.\n\n>What I learned is that activation functions are applied over each neuron, so something is not adding up.\n\nThis is usually true, but it is not true for softmax.\n\n>Is softmax applied \"outside\" the network - therefore it is not an actual activation function and therefore the actual last activation is identity (a -> a)?\n\nThis is kind of quibbling with definitions. But yes, this would make sense too.\n\n>Or is second to last layer with size 3 and identities for activation functions and then there's somehow a single neuron with weights frozen to 1 (and the softmax for activation)? (this kind of makes sense to me, but it does not match up with say Keras api)\n\nI dont understand this sentence.",
        "I would rewrite as \"just any **non linear** function\". Nonlinearity is what brings the bread home.",
        "Activation functions can be trainable:\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00817\n\nI agree with the below comment about the important thing that defines an activation function is that it adds non linearity",
        "Notice that there are activation functions with trainable parameters such as Leaky Relu in its negative part.",
        "[https://imgur.com/a/0uygXdy](https://imgur.com/a/0uygXdy)\n\n  \nso does this formal of a neuron definition not always hold true?",
        "Parametric relu has trainable parameters but is still an activation function. I agree that it's more about non-linearity.",
        "Nevermind, I was confused as how could a activation function be applied over entire layer, since I was following the math expression for a neuron from beginner lectures \\`sigma(W.X + b)\\`\n\n  \n..which I take is just a sort of general rule but set in stone?",
        "Very important point. NN with linear activation = linear regression",
        "If you refer to the g not having extra params - that's more of a simplification. Just assume the sum by which we divide is implicitly embedded into the g. \n\nAlso, I'm pretty sure you can express softmax as a combination of “pure” activations. Something like pointwise exp followed my a sum and division"

Don't forget that self-hosting ALSO costs a lot of electricity bills so I would discourage setting up your own local multi-FPU server.",
        "Few things here:\n\nOn a hardware level, you cannot just \"combine\" two cards, intranode communication still plays a part. And it's a little harder to deal with when training cause in practice you need (cuda:0) and (cuda:1). Yes I know frameworks that handle multi GPU exist but I'm just saying in theory. NVIDIA also removed NVLink for consumer cards, didn't follow the news for the gaming cards so I'm not sure if anything changed. That would cause quite a bit of slowdown compared to single GPU. Another potential hardware note is PCIE lanes that can also cause slowdown. I need more time to look into this because I am not too familiar with this yet. \n\nI would be careful with more than one GPU, it's just another hurdle. For learning, exploring architectures, algorithms more importantly would be compute capability, which the newer RTX cards should be fine. \n\nLastly, the gaming cards just use so much power, I don't know if undervolting them to the server level would match but yea they just run toasty. Remember to get blower cards unless your RIG has enough space between them.",
        "You don't need much VRAM for image classification problems (its very different from generative models in that sense). A 3090 with 24GB is enough to train ViT-B from scratch. Generally, having more VRAM lets you train with a larger batch size and training with larger batch sizes lets you train your models faster. Therefore, if you get a 5090 or two 5090s you can train your models significantly faster. However, like others have said, don't expect the speed up of multi gpu systems to be proportional. I have seen stats saying that systems with four gpus are three times as fast as a single gpu.\n\nHowever, before getting a new GPU, you need to make sure that you don't have any bottlenecks in your data pipeline. Imagenet is \\~150GB, therefore is you don't have at least that much RAM available (SDRAM not VRAM) then getting another GPU may not be worth it.",

    "selftext": "\nInitially, the model wasn’t learning, despite various efforts, and I traced the issue back to the preprocessing stage where the images weren’t quite suitable for the model’s learning process. After experimenting with different techniques, I decided to transform the images into grayscale and applied cv2 CLAHE to adjust the contrast. While this did help the model start learning, the validation accuracy stubbornly stayed below 45%, making me realize that there was still a gap in the model’s performance.\n\nThis led me to rethink my approach. After doing further research and experimentation, I decided to make some significant changes to the preprocessing pipeline. First, I switched the dataset back to colored images, which I had originally used. Additionally, I introduced a Gaussian blur filter with cv2, which added some noise to the images during preprocessing. This subtle but impactful change improved the model’s accuracy by about 3%. It was a small win, but it felt like a breakthrough!\n\nWith this new setup in place, I moved on to fine-tuning the model. I leveraged ResNet101 and DenseNet101 pre-trained models, both of which are known for their ability to learn complex patterns efficiently. I modified the classifier layers to align better with my dataset, and the results were nothing short of impressive. I was able to push the model’s accuracy on the validation set to a solid 80%, which was a huge improvement from where I started.\n\nThis experience has truly been a good reminder of the power of persistence and iteration in deep learning. It’s often easy to get stuck or discouraged when things aren’t working, but sometimes the breakthrough comes from revisiting the basics, experimenting with new techniques, and learning from the process itself. I’m thrilled with the progress so far, but this is only the beginning. There’s still much to learn and improve upon, and I’m looking forward to continuing this journey.\n\nI would love to hear any thoughts or suggestions from the community on further optimizations, model improvements, or preprocessing techniques that could enhance the results even more!\n\n#DeepLearning #AI #PyTorch #MachineLearning #DiabeticRetinopathy #ModelOptimization #ResNet101 #DenseNet101 #MachineLearningJourney #AICommunity #AI #MachineLearning #MedicalImaging #ModelOptimization #AICommunity #Innovation",

        "That cooler will throttle and cook your i9. CPU etc doesnt matter that much - jsut get the am4 setup with ddr4 ram and save some money. Think 5800x, 128gb ddr4 3600 ram, decent mobo with x8 pcie lanes. Get an used 3090 to begin with, the 5000 series is around the corner and you will lose 1k easily on the 4090 in the next six months.",
        " Hi if you are thinking to train the LLM model on your shown PC parts then i am sorry to say that it won't work becuase for training the LLM you need some good of VRAM and 24gb is then not enough unless and until you are going to use 4 bit precision but then your accuracy will suffer.but if you are only using the pretrained model for the inference task you can use the api directly and for that this much requirements is not needed.",
        "unironically in a PC setup, any strong RTX gaming card would be just as fit for deep learning lol. \nBut if you are talking about training LLM (7B,13B,70B..), there is almost no PC Card that would suffice. You could do smaller LLM inference in your 4090, sure. But for training, without the good ol’ A100/A40 etc. the only feasible way to do it is to reduce the transformer blocks. But that’s not quite LLM is it.\nFor vision models though your setup is more than capable.",
        "Keep dual GPU build in mind even if you start with single GPU:\n\n* mb should support at least 2x PCI-E x16 slots, x8/x8, (eg.: Asus x670e creator)\n* bigger case with plenty of space and extra slots (eg.: Phanteks Enthoo Pro 2 Server Edition)\n* AIO for CPU cooling, to avoid heat accumulation\n* at least single AIO GPU, all air 4090 are 3 slot design, impossible to fit in most MBs. 4090 with AIO is 2 slot so you keep it as top GPU\n* more ram, at least 48gb\\*2\n* psu 1500W+",

        "I just got a (deeply) discounted Dell Alienware Aurora-16 w/ slightly better specs (i9-1400kf, 64GB, water cooling, RTX-4090/24GB) for less than your total, and that includes the warranty. The only drawback is the difficulty in adding a 2nd 4090 (when they get cheap). OF COURSE, my system is already BIOS/PS compatible with the coming 5090...",
        "Wheynelau has a good point about the Ampere series A6000...I have considered various combinations of cards, but ultimately plan on upgrading w/ the 5090, due to the promise of the 32 GB video RAM. I also am in the NVIDIA developer program, and HOPE 🙏 to have access to an early-release THOR...🤸",
        "We're all on this exploration together, my friend! 🌐",
        "My assumption is that you will train/fine tune in the cloud, and want the on-prem\n for inference?",
        "you could buy a lot of compute with that from e.g. Lightning Studios...",
        "Wait for the 5090",
        "Are you planning to use it only for inference, or also for training?\n\nDo you have any experience with training DL models, which could help to direct the build?\n\nIn general, more memory is better. It would be better to get 96GB or 128GB of RAM. My rig utilizes 2x48GB 6600MT, and there is nothing faster in this capacity. During inference some models happily utilize my 3090 and over 80% of RAM\n\nFor smaller models you may also consider the Apple way - unified memory is shared between GPU and CPU and can provide better performance in some cases. And for bigger models - cloud is more feasible. I've seen folks utilizing some older server mobos with 384+GB of RAM for inference, but for beginners such amounts of memory seem to be unnecessary\n\n  \nI would recommend sticking to what you have now, while waiting for Black Friday or release of RTX 5000 series. Meanwhile, just run any local and cloud workloads you get interested in. You may use cheap cloud providers like runpod (or anything else) to see what interests you, and which part of the built you should focus on",
        "Need a better CPU cooler (as others have mentioned) and that 4090 is waaay overpriced (as is that WD HDD).  You may already know this, but you can get a 4090 for $1650-1800, depending on sale. If you're looking to trim costs, the jedi move is to find a refurb 3090 or 3090 ti for \\~$600-800, and purchase a store replacement warranty (e.g. for 10-15% extra on top of purchase price, the store can offer you insurance where if the refurb card breaks within 2-3 years, they'll give you your money back).\n\nIf you're price insensitive, get an A6000 with 48gb of memory (non-Ada). You'll find out real quick VRAM is very, VERY desired.",
        "Yup it has all the parts, the PC will work",
        "Honestly, seems like you’re new to this. Even a mac mini or macbook pro will work really well for smaller models. i9 definitely overkill since you’re gonna do stuff on gpu. just make sure CPU has enough threads",
        "I see. Thank you very much for your suggestions.",
        "I see, for the LLM training, I may consider using cloud.",

        "Yes, for vision transformers it is the same. these days 24GB it is only useful for toy projects (I know because I have one 4090 that I barely can use). \n\nThink twice about your use case, because it could be that you barely use that computer for serious deep learning",

        "I paid $3190.00 and ordered directly from Dell. I am currently playing w/ Llama 3.2 inference/RAG/C.O.T @ 300 + tokens per sec. Your and my research efforts are very closely aligned, and I find that with Dell the technical support for the compute portion is well worth it. I would rather invest my time into the algorithmic or data-centric explorations than troubleshooting hardware problems w/ 5-6 different hardware vendors. NVIDIA REALLY likes the Alienware line, and have tons of cool drivers, too. Intel has finally fixed the over-clocking/power profile, too - so I can (and have-for a short time) boosted to as much as 6.1 GHZ. You just need to watch your thermal profiles...👍",
        "As a matter of fact, I am torture testing the new BIOS patch right now for the i9-1400kf over-volt issues, and, since I am consistently getting 6.1 GHZ with thermal profile III, I hereby pronounce the Aurora-16 your best choice!!🎇",
        "Are you sure? That SUCKS...🤔",
        "By serious deep learning you mean ViT and LLM? There are still many other DL architectures.\n\nHow much VRAM do we need for ViT and serious computer vision problems. Is 32 GB of VRAM (in RTX 5090) enough for such tasks?",
        "How much research have you done on your part? Are you open to considering the non gaming GPUs? The A series are good for your use cases.\n\nWe need more information on the workloads, I have done \"LLM, text and vision\" tasks with a 8GB card. These questions are very common.",
        "Awesome, thank you again for your suggestions.",
        "I think 5090 will come with 28, not 32. For LLM minimum for a small model is around 80GB (for training, not for inference).\nFor diffusion or ViT models you could train in 24GB, but it is going to take so long you would need to parallelize or a bigger GPU.\nFor something you will want to put in production you need to train in the cloud (I am not considering models for mobile devices or similar, that use case is fine)",
        "Non gaming GPUs should be the best for me, but I am considering of the price. A series GPU price should be much higher than 4090, is that right? Do you have any recommendation of A series card?",
        "Thanks.\n\nFrom newest rumors they say that RTX will arrive in january 2025 with 32 GB VRAM.",

I would be hard pressed to find an actually deep network being trained using just minibatch sgd today.\n* Order of operations  is implementation dependent, what you say is true for pytorch.\n* \"curved nature of logarithm\" is verging on nonsensical, the structure of cross entropy loss is born from shannon entropy, its a different tool for a different job.

Upon rereading the test, I see how what I said was unclear. The curved nature of the logarithm allows for more significant steps for bad predictions (making it converge quicker). If my statement does not convince you, there is an excellent Statquest video that illustrates this:  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArSys5qHAU&t=494s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArSys5qHAU&t=494s)   7:55",
        "Larger gradient towards better predictions is a fair statement to make, curved nature of logarithm is not, show me a loss function without a \"curved nature\".\nEven the video you reference is making a claim about the tangent which is talking about the derivative/gradient.\nBut more broadly you are looking at the symptom of a good loss as the reason the loss is good. You want losses that given large adjustments to large errors, that is trivially true and not unique to cross entropy. The interesting question is why cross entropy does this well for classification problems."

        "the naive approach would be to find identify these detects by human researches, label the data set, then use it for training. Checking whether AI says the same phrase in exactly same way is also useful and maybe doesn't even require AI model. AI voice tends to have limited scope of intonations it can do.

    "selftext": "As a deep learning engineer, I've been working on a project to classify diabetic retinopathy using PyTorch for the past few days. Initially, I encountered a roadblock: my model simply wasn’t learning. \n\nTo say it was frustrating would be an understatement. I combed through my code multiple times, re-evaluated the architecture, and even tweaked hyperparameters, but nothing seemed to move the needle. It became evident that the issue wasn’t the model itself but something deeper—something in the data or preprocessing steps was holding the network back from reaching its potential\n\nAfter a lot of troubleshooting, I decided to take a closer look at how I was handling my input data. Diabetic retinopathy is visually subtle, with key indicators often being faint changes in the images of the retina. The raw images I had been feeding into the network were, as it turned out, not doing my model any favors.\n\nI pivoted my attention towards image preprocessing and started experimenting with different methods. One of the breakthroughs came when I applied CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) using OpenCV (cv2). CLAHE is a powerful technique for enhancing the local contrast of images, which can be especially useful for medical imagery, where minute details matter a lot. I combined this with transforming the images to grayscale, which allowed the network to focus on the essential features rather than being distracted by color information.\n\nThis step was crucial. Once I implemented this contrast adjustment and grayscaling process, I finally saw improvements; the model was learning! The training accuracy improved significantly, and I felt like I was on the right path.\n\nHowever, despite these improvements, the validation accuracy is still hovering around 40-45%, and I can't seem to push past this mark.\n\nIf you’ve worked on medical image classification or have experience with similar challenges, I’d love to hear from you!\n\n\nI’m excited about the progress, but there’s still a long way to go. Have any of you faced similar challenges? I’d love to hear your ideas or suggestions on how I can improve the model’s accuracy.\n\nAdditionally, if there are resources or research papers you think might help, I’m all ears. It’s been an exciting journey so far, and I’m eager to push through this roadblock.\n\n#DeepLearning #PyTorch #DiabeticRetinopathy #MachineLearning #AI #EngineeringJourney #ModelOptimization #LearningFromChallenges #AICommunity",

    "title": "LLM Evaluations and determinants of a Responsible AI system\n",
    "selftext": "In this article I would go straight into highlighting some key evaluations to defining the credibility of an LLM system alongside guides to such system as a responsible AI.\n\nEvery trained or built LLM system is built out of a transformer-based architecture that has learnt so well the maximum-likelyhood of a word given a bag/set of words. Moreover, every LLM system is as good as credibility of it’s data sources.\n\nThe next big question to ask is this, after training a good LLM of probably 13B-65B or more parameter, how safe is this LLM in terms of it’s expected performances and all? This article outlines some common evaluations LLM ought to go through in comparison with the expected standards, which allows us to determine how responsible an AI can be.\n\nBelow are some evaluations LLM ought to be subjected to inorder to determine how safe or responsible it can be:\n\n1. Common Sense reasoning — Responsible LLMs ought to be subjected to common sense reasoning with reference to popular benchmarks inorder to determine how well it does it. The better the performance beyond standard benchmarks, the more credible it’s sense of reasoning can be. Some typical common sense reasoning benchmarks are BoolQ (Clark et al., 2019), PIQA (Bisk et al., 2020), SIQA (Sap et al., 2019), HellaSwag (Zellers et al., 2019), WinoGrande (Sakaguchi et al., 2021), ArC easy and challenge (Clark et al., 2018) and OpenBookQA (Mihaylov et al., 2018).\n2. Closed-book Question and Answering test — Subjecting an LLM to a closed book setting where the models does not have access to documents that contain evidence to answer the question is another way of evaluating your LLM with respect to best practices. You can always compare your LLM performance with other LLMs like GPT-3, Gopher, Chinchilla, PaLM and LLaMA that have been subjected to the same evaluation.\n3. Reading Comprehension Test — You can evaluate your LLM on RACE reading comprehension benchmark (Lai et al., 2017), you can then compare the performance of your LLM with respect to other LLMs that have been subjected to this test like GPT-3, PaLM and LLaMA. This helps you evaluate how well your LLM is performing in terms of how it reads and comprehends what it is reading.\n4. Mathematical reasoning test — Your LLMs can also be subjected to math problems to see how well it compares to other LLMs like PaLM, Minerva and LLaMA that have been subjected to the same test based off the two mathematical reasoning benchmarks, MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) and GSM8k (Cobbe et al., 2021). MATH is a dataset of 12K middle school and high school mathematics problems written in LaTeX. GSM8k is a set of middle school mathematical problems.\n5. Code Generation — If you feel your LLM was built solely for code generation you could try test it on two benchmarks for code generation, HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021) and MBPP (Austin et al., 2021). LLMs like PaLM, LaMDA and LLaMA models have been subjected to the same, you could compare your model performance with them.\n6. Multi-tasking language understanding — Some LLMs are good at Multi-tasking which is multiple choice questions covering various domains of knowledge in humanities, STEM and social sciences. LLMs that passes this test are LLMs that are unbiased towards any field of interest. LLMs that have been subjected to this test includes: Chinchilla, PALM and LLaMA.\n7. Toxicity Test — LLMs are prone to biases due to their training data and they could most like generate toxic or offensive contents. Hence, the need to evaluate on different benchmarks that measure toxic content production and stereotypes detection. You could test your LLM via a 3rd party API called [PerspectiveAPI](https://perspectiveapi.com/).\n8. CrowS-Pairs — This test allows to evaluate LLMs biases on CrowS-Pairs (Nangia et al., 2020). The dataset allows to measure biases on 9 categories: gender, religion, race/color, sexual orientation, age, nationality, disability, physical appearance and socioeconomic status. Your LLM can also be compared to other LLMs that went through this test like GPT-3, OPT, LLaMA.\n9. WinoGender — This test helps to investigate biases in our model specifically on gender. The WinoGender benchmark (Rudinger et al., 2018) evaluates biases based on if a model co-reference resolution peformance is impacted by the gender of the pronoun, that is the how and the usage of pronouns.\n10. TruthfulQA — TruthfulQA (lin et al., 2021) aims to measure the truthfulness of a model, that is the ability for a model to identify when a claim is true or false.\n\nIn conclusion, how responsible an AI can be is dependent on how well an AI responds to the above tests/ evaluations. Let’s do well to promote more responsible AI systems in the ecosystem.\n\nCheers.\n\n# Reference\n\nLLaMA: Open and Efficient Foundation Language Models — [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.13971](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.13971)",

        "Learning to build something well takes time.\n\nFirst let's make something clear - you are using pretrained VGG-16 weights, right? You are **not** training from scratch?",
        "What is \"trying to follow\" an architecture ?\nWhat is your t'ask/problem ? What is your dataset ?",
        "I would recommend to start with a simple CNN then move to autoendcoder, U-Net kind of thing for learning",
        "If you train from scratch with no pretraines weights, you wont get good results with few data.",
        "Maybe u can use Gpt architecture",
        "I don’t use a pretrained model. Since I am a student the goal is to develop a model by myself that will reach a great score on the test datasets and don’t use a pretrained model at all.",
        "Since I am new in Machine Learning, Deep Learning I am trying to accomplish great accuracy score for complex classification tasks (where there are so many labels). I wanna develop the NN architecture by myself but I am trying to follow the successful classification architectures to understand why they work.",
        "Well, you can't do that easily with VGG-16.\n\n\nIf you want to train it from scratch, you'll need to match the training somewhat to what VGG-16 was pretrained on, ImageNet. That means that if you have 1M samples which are distributed into 1000 classes, 224x224 resolution, with a batch size of 32, and a 0.01 starting learning rate that is cut 10x every 30 epochs, you need 90 epochs.\n\n\nSo essentially, for 1000 classes, a VGG-16 model needs to see roughly 90 million samples. If you have 10 classes, you might be able to cut it to roughly 9 million samples. Note that it doesn't scale linearly. For example, if you had 2 classes, you would still need at least 5 million samples.\n\n\nNow, I assume you have much less samples. If you tell me how much, I can give you an estimate on how long you'll need to train it, and then you can see if that's worth it for you.\n\n\nSo give me the number of images, number of classes, and their native resolution.",
        "The dataset consists of 15 000 images with 50 classes. I am not sure for the resolution of the images but I resized them to 224x224. Thank you for the help!",
        "Hi ! I'm also quite new to machine learning, how do do you know you need to have 90 epochs ? What's the maths behind that ?",
        "The native resolution of the image is important because it tells you what the batch size should roughly be. If you have bigger native images, then the batch size should be bigger to account for more variance in the data.\n\nWith the class count, I would say you need 20-50 million training steps for VGG-16. It of course depends on how complex the task is and how well tied the input is to the output.\n\nWith 15000 images, that comes down to 1333-3333 epochs. I would wager that you could get by with 1000 epochs if you use augmentation techniques, such as AutoAugment, TrivialAugment or LatentAugment. However, I would also say that if you're willing to invest the resources into training for so long, your efforts would probably be better spent on something like ResNet18, an overall superior, yet still simple model.\n\nOverall, no wonder your model is performing poorly when you're training it for 1.5% of the training time I proposed, which itself is a relatively conservative estimate.\n\nTo conclude, my proposal is:\n\n- batch size of 32\n- 1000 epochs\n- Auto/Trivial/LatentAugment applied to images\n- SGD optimizer (not ADAM!)\n- starting learning rate of 0.01 for VGG16, or 0.1 for ResNet18, divided by 10 every 400 epochs (so when you reach epoch 400, your learning rate becomes 0.001 or 0.01, depending on the model, 1e-4 or 1e-3 at epoch 800)\n\nOR, use the pretrained weights and finetune:\n\n- batch size of 32\n- 10 epochs\n- Auto/Trivial/LatentAugment applied to images\n- ADAM optimizer\n- starting learning rate 1e-3/1e-2, 1e-4/1e-3 at epoch 5, 1e-5/1e-4 at epoch 7, 1e-6/1e-5 at epoch 9\n\nThe pretrained model is not cheating, it will allow you to skip most of your training from scratch because the model has already learned about what images are, and you only have to teach it what *your* images are, you don't have to start from nothing.",
        "Almost nothing is maths - it's simply looking at how much you need to train a model with another dataset, specifically in this case ImageNet1k.\n\n\nIf you look at the VGG16 paper, they trained for 74 epochs. If you look at the PyTorch reproduction of said pretraining, they used 90 epochs. In reality, ImageNet has more than 1M samples in train, so to make things simple I took the 90 epochs from Pytorch, alongside 1M samples, which is reduced from the 1.3M in the original paper to match it.\n\n\nNumber of epochs doesn't really matter, what matters is the number of steps, 90M in this case for 1000 classes, or 20-50M for 50 classes (although this is an estimate), which then you use to divide the number of samples with and to get to the actual number of epochs you need.\n\n\nThe authors trained for that length of time based on the evaluation error. But usually it's better to train for even more than the papers say, especially with modern networks.\n\n\nOverall, it's a rule of a thumb. No one knows the optimal parameters on how much to train a network, but looking at previous work can give you a rough estimate.",
        "Thank you so much! Your instructions did the work. After 100 epochs the model reached more than 80% accuracy.",
        "Oh I see thanks for the answer!",
        "Great to see it working that early!"

        "I think it's cheaper just to rent a GPU for the time you train your model instead of buying one just for DL. Vast.ai or so is a lot cheaper I think.",
        "In fact, it’s difficult to determine whether buying a PC with an RTX 4090 would be more suitable. \n\nGenerally, there are two options for learning or training models: using your own PC or renting GPUs from a server company.\n\nIf you are in the early stages of learning or only need to train small deep learning models, using a PC equipped with a powerful GPU is a more cost-effective choice. It incurs lower expenses and can be used not only for learning deep learning but also for everyday entertainment.\n\nFor fine-tuning low-parameter LLMs, you can use the 4090; however, 24GB of VRAM is insufficient for larger parameter models. As far as I know, using NVIDIA GPUs on Linux is no longer an issue, and all my code runs on Linux without any problems with NVIDIA GPU usage.\n\nWhile it’s not feasible to train large models from scratch, you can build the architecture of a large model and then train an LLM using a very small dataset.\n\nCompared to a Mac, I do not recommend it because training models on Mac devices is quite challenging due to GPU limitations. If you buy a Mac, you'll need to rent GPUs from a server company.\n\nOverall, you have two options:\n\n1. Purchase a PC for initial learning, then rent GPUs, using the PC to connect remotely for continued learning and model training.\n2. Alternatively, buy a Mac, rent GPUs, and use the Mac to connect to a remote server for learning and model training.",
        "If you are serious about it, there's a trend of AI server companies launching desktop PCs specifically designed for local AI training.

    "selftext": "Hello all, I’ve been bugging around in this subreddit for specific problems for a while now. My model is essentially a deepfake detection model(voice) for my native language.\n\n\nI have a dataset around 4500 (inclusive of equal number of real and fake voices) voice lines, since I am new to audio processing and relatively new to deep learning in general, I was testing out with 780 of the 4500 voicelines (390 of real and ai generated).\n\n\n\n\nMy model performed well on predicting from rest of the dataset which I did not conduct training/testing/validation on(4500-780 =3,720). It could easily predict wether it was real or fake. But when I tried to generate some ai voices via tools online like text to speech, then downloaded and fed it to the model, it could not predict it correctly. Similarly, I recorded my own voice on a laptop mic and fed it to the model, it failed to predict again, which leads to believe me there’s some audio processing issues which I need to address? Or is this a model issue which I cannot perceive? Really in a fix here and could use some help. Anyone worked in relevant field of audio/ in general any help would be great honestly.\n\n\n\nYou can find the dataset, I attached the URL in the post. \n\n\n\n\n\nAbout my model: \nIt takes MFCCs and feeds it to a CNN model, total parameters: 44,929\nTrainable: 44,737\nNon trainable: 192\n\n\n(This seems relatively less but part of my task was to lastly convert this model to a lightweight one, for edge deployment)",

Given this low loss from the first epoch, should I focus on training with more data or on adjusting the architecture and layers to be even more complex, etc.?\n2. Given the small differences between the first epoch and the last, is it more likely that the model was barely able to improve performance during these epochs, or could the difference in loss still be meaningful?\n\nThe dataset count was of 10,000 images - 0.9 for training, 0.1 for validation.\n\n**First epoch loss:** Epoch \\[1/50\\], Training Loss: 0.026428, **Validation Loss: 0.023727**   \n**Last epoch and plateau:** Epoch \\[34/50\\], Training Loss: 0.020682, **Validation Loss: 0.020651**",

        "It depends on the training objective / loss function. In many cases, this is the expected behavior - for example, diffusion models can have very low loss (due to L2 metric), but do not see a large decrease per epoch due to the training objective (i.e. noise injection and image variability). Models that use CE on the other hand (classifiers, or masked autoencoders) will see a more steady loss decrease since the base entropy value will be much higher (such as an asymptotic entropy of 2.5).\n\nWhat you are most likely seeing is the model very quickly crunching the weights into the learning regime (e.g. a loss of 1.0 -> 0.03 in the first 1k steps) followed by steady learning progress. Scaling up parameters is probably not the best method here given your small dataset size, but scaling both together may result in a steeper loss-slope. Typically these can be modeled by broken power-laws, where the exponent is a function of the model capacity, but too large of a capacity with limited data will end up degrading performance at earlier epochs (this is a common issue with GANs training on small sets like FFHQ / CelebA-HQ).",
        "The details depend on how you have programmed your training loop. Normally, you calculate the loss on training before the optimization step. The validation would then be tested after optimization. As a consequence, training loss (from before optimization step) can be larger than loss from validation (applied after optimization step). The difference will be more pronounced on earlier epochs. For later epochs, the validation loss is basically one iteration ahead."

    "selftext": "Hello experts,\n\nI am a bit confused about the true stats/science behind the LATENT SPACE of conditional Variational Autoencoders (cVAE).\n\nContext: I am working with a problem which includes two input features (x1 and x2) with 1000 observations of each, it is not an image reconstruction problem. Let's consider x1 and x2 be the random samples from two different distribution, whereas 'y' is the function of x1 and x2. For my LSTM-based cVAE, encoder generates 2 outputs (mu and sigma) for each sample of x1 and x2, thus generating 1000 values of mu and sigma. I am very clear about reparametrization of 'z' and using it in decoder. The dimensionality of my latent space is 1.\n\nQuestion: How does encoder generates two values that are assigned as mu and sigma? I mean what is the real transformation from (x1,x2) to (mu,sigma) if I have to write an equation. Secondly, if there are 1000 distributions for 1000 samples, what is the point of data compression and dimensionality reduction? and wouldn't it be a very high dimensional model if it has 1000 distributions? Lastly, estimating a whole distribution (mu,sigma) from single value of x1 and x2 each, is it really reliable???\n\nBonus question: if I have to visualize this 1-D latent space with 1000 distributions in it, what are my option?\n\nThank for your patience.\n\nExpecting some very interesting perspectives.",

        "The general goal of the VAE is to make the latent space a bit \"nicer\". You force inputs to be mapped to a distribution instead of a point, which creates fuzzier boundaries between latent features. This allows for nicer interpolation.\n\nIf you had to write an equation for the encoder, it would be a series of matrix multiplications followed by bias additions and nonlinear function applications for each layer. Just like for any neural network.\n\nI don't understand why you think it's a high dimensional representation if the latent space only has a dimension of 1?\n\nAre you familiar with normal autoencoders? A VAE is the same if you set sigma to zero. The sigma term simply adds some noise to the latent space to aid in interpolation and \"spread out\" the latent space as I described.",
        "Thank you for your detailed answer.\n\nThe thing about high dimensionality is that I am working (for now) with two input variables only and have 1000 samples of both, therefore, my input data has 1000 samples of (x1,x2) or (x1,x2,y) in case of CVAE. And the encoder is giving me one set of (mu,sigma) for each sample thus generating 1000 sets of (mu,sigma). This is what confuses me, either I should have one (mu,sigma) that represents 1000 (x1,x2) or I should get separate for each sample?",
        "Don't think of the mu and sigma as a distribution. Just think of it as a fuzzy estimate of where and how the input is represented in the latent space. It's basically just gaussian sampling, the mu and sigma are only used to add some amount of noise to z. They aren't actually used by the decoder at all.\n\nIn a normal autoencoder latent space, you will have pretty sharp and irregularly shaped boundaries in the latent space which will cause problems with interpolation. You can't smoothly move between different \"classes\" by slowly changing the value of z, there won't be smooth transitions like there are in the VAE latent space.\n\nBtw, if you want to visualize the latent space, it should be pretty easy. If your latent space is only 1, you will basically just have a line. If your inputs have class labels, you could use those to visualize by giving a different color to each class. You should see similar colors grouped together along the line.\n\nAlso, you have such a low-dimensional problem that I'm not sure VAEs would be the best solution. But you can try. In my experience though, VAEs can be quite hard to work with and they simply won't be able to learn to represent certain types of data."

In the 3rd chapter, page 27, there's a paragraph just above section 3.1.2\n\n>Each hidden unit contributes one \"joint\" to the function, so with three hidden units, there can be four linear regions. However, only ***three of the slopes of these regions are independent;*** the fourth is either zero (if all the hidden units are inactive in this region) or is a sum of slopes from the other regions.\n\nI need help understanding what the independence of slope in a region means. Additionally, which regions have independent slopes?\n\nAccording to the depiction in Figure 3.3 on page 28,\n\nRegion 1: h3 active\n\nRegion 2: h3 and h1 active\n\nRegion 3: h3, h1 and h2 active\n\nRegion 4: h1 and h2 active\n\n\n\nI've been talking with chatGPT, and it says that Regions 1, 2, and 3 are independent, but Region 4 is dependent. The first three are independent because, in each of them, one new hidden node contributes. Region 4 loses the contribution from one of the previously active hidden units and is, therefore, constraint by the slope of the previous region and must adjust accordingly.\n\nThis is difficult for me to understand. I can't make sense of it visually. The recurring question in my head is: \"Big deal, why does it make it dependent?\"  \n  \nIf you have some resources or some logic or trick to make sense of it, please do share.   \nI couldv'e just skipped the paragraph and moved ahead, but this one word \"independent\" is stuck in my head.",

Data augmentation as well. You would use it depending on the application and how much data you have.\n\nDropout is used in the original transformers paper if I remember correctly?\n\nGradient clipping was mostly only needed in the case of RNNs due to the recurrent structure and exploding gradients.

However, attention mechanism itself doesn't show to be powerful in vision tasks. So CNNs are still mainstream in CV. You may argue that some works, like taming transformers, leverage transformer to do image generation. But these use CNNs to do tokenization prior to transformer blocks, and transformer blocks still work at the token level, not pixel level. \n\nTL;DR: For NLP, partially yes. transformer is significantly stronger than other models; for other fields like CV and RL, no.",

        "Depends for what. It's nowhere near enough for most modern things. It's OKish if you're working with stuff older than 2018.",
        "I hope so, everyone keeps saying that 12gb is not enough but they never elaborate on what they work on, so it is probably true that is not enough, but also depends on the context.\nWhat I've gathered by reading online is that, as long as you don't want to go production level with LLMs you should be fine.",
        "Is low for LLms and images(often) but is usually enough for other types of data, depends",
        "for CV 10gb is fine. I did my cv experiments on a 8gb 3070",
        "12 gb is good enough for most CV tasks. \n\nThe 4070ti super is the best consumer card for non LLM tasks. \n\n3090 is bare minimum if you want to run LLM inference or fine tune a 7b model",
        "Depending on the GPU, your card may run out of memory before saturating the compute power, it will result in 60-80% GPU usage when training.\n\nMoreover, depending on model’s size, the difference between 12(100%) and 16(133%) may be greater than 33% more memory:\n\n* 1GB: 11 vs 15 -> 36% more usable memory \n* 2GB: 10 vs 14 -> 40% more usable memory\n* 3GB: 9 vs 13 -> 44% more usable memory\n* 4GB: 8 vs 12 -> 50% more usable memory\n\nEtc..\n\nPersonally I wouldn’t go beneath 16GB unless financially constrained.\n\nLE: unless you run a headless system, windows takes another 800Mb of VRAM, on linux xfce takes around 500MB",
        "Without any information about what kind of data you want to work with, no one can answer your question.\nFor my usage, 48GB is my acceptable minimum",
        "I don't really know why so many people here seem to struggle with their VRAM. Unless you are dealing with LLMs, one does not need that much VRAM if training is implemented efficiently. You can also calculate your approximate VRAM requirements.\n\nApprox. VRAM per Batch:\nBatch_size * Channels * Height * Width * Bytes_per_Value\n E.g. 128 * 3 * 512 * 512 * 4 / 1e6 ≈ 400 MB per Batch \n\nApprox. Model parameter size you can use during training per 1 GB of VRAM:\nVRAM_GB * 1e9 / Bytes_per_Param / 4\nE.g. 10GB * 1e9 / 4 / 4 ≈ 625M Parameters\n\nThe calculations suggest that you can probably train a 625M parameter model with a batch size of 128 with 512 Pixel RGB images with your 12GB VRAM. Maybe a bit less to account for overhead and system usage. Note that I assumed 32bit float values therefore 4 bytes per value/parameter. Also during training the Optimizer usually saves several states of your model so you need to multiply the total model size by at least 3 or 4 during training but this does not apply to inference. I used 4 in my calculation just to make sure.\n\nPerformance recommendation:\n1. You can use very small batch sizes to decrease the VRAM size of each batch. And then use gradient accumulation to virtually increase batch size as large as you like.\n2. Use a dataloader so you only need to stream the batches to VRAM and do not put the whole dataset into the VRAM at once. This introduces some CPU and bandwidth overhead but saves a lot of VRAM and your dataset can be arbitrarly large.\n3. Use mixed precision or just train in bfloat16. This halfs your model size and you can make use of the Ada Lovelace GPUs Tensor Cores which should also speed up training.\n\nSo with 12 GB of VRAM and the above implementations you should definitely be able to train models up to 500M parameters which should suffice for most CV tasks!",
        "May I ask what type of projects they are? I have been using google colab so far for my computer vision tasks but I've had enough and I want to do work locally and my vram consumption never seemed to go much above 10Gb as the models I use are quite modest",

        "is there a significant hurdle to using, say, a second 3060 over upgrading to a beefier (single) card?",
        "Brother in Christ you can't even experiment on small LLMs with 12 GB, let alone \"go production level\". You can't even \"go production level\" with BERT, a 6 year old model with 300M parameters.",
        "Yeah I don't even intend on touching llms or language processing in general, i'm more focused on vision tasks and such. Not very advanced, just learning about architectures and seeing some results, not full scale productions, and I was intending to purchase an nvidia gpu for that",
        "Ah great! I am actually working on cv as well (suffering with google colab) and I just wanted to work on a local machine with far more flexibility (im on amd right now :|)",
        "Yeah I am working on CV on google colab and I just wanted to swap to a local machine for at least the prototyping. So long as I can do that with 12 gb to determine that my model will actually train, I might just go for that option and then rent out gpus or use a cloud for the actual training",
        "Ahh yeah I understand what you mean, and I am seriously considering the 16gb card but if I will still end up having to rent more powerful gpus to actually train the models I might as well go for the 4070 Super for prototyping and my other rendering workloads\n\nI just think Nvidia made an anti consumer move is all, either by giving 16gb to a 4060 Ti with half the bandwidth, giving the 4070 Super 12 Gb for a moderately expensive card (700 euro) is a joke, and forcing people to pay even more for a 4070 Ti Super if they want 16gb\n\nBut oh well nevermind the rant, thanks for the help",
        "Yeah I should have made that a lot clearer, but I don't intend on working on any LLMs or nlp, i'm mostly focused on computer vision tasks, for example i'm currently working on a denoiser for my renderer on google colab but it's a massive pain",
        "Yeah the ones that push my local memory are the vision tasks. I do a bunch of things but right now working on image to image training (pseudo-super resolution). To be honest the more frustrating part is the curating and amplifying datasets part. If I hit the vram constraint and I’m confident it works then I’ll just go to a cloud. But for preparing / augmenting training data it’s really time consuming and I do wish I had a better computer all around. Give me multiple better computers and I could really get some good training done 🤣. \nBut you should be fine at 12gb for most projects.",
        "I think it's a constant struggle until we get into 80+GB vram.. I've considered upgrading to 16gb but it doesn't really change anything for me, still need the same tricks and optimizations. I'm seriously considering getting two 4090s but I bet that with all the new possibilities they bring, I'll just hit new limits and the story repeats",
        "I'm not sure I haven't tried, someone needs to try it and let us know",
        "Yeah and a 3080 won’t be as fast as a cloud machine.",
        "If you dont work with 3d image it should be enough, \nMaybe a little low if you want to work on 2d 512x512 rgb images.",
        "Aaah I see, I have also noticed that preparing the data is a massive time consuming effort indeed. I am also working on a image to image denoiser model for 3d renders and I wanted to know if I could finally just buy a 4070 Super (12Gb) and be done with it or if I should save more for the 4070 Ti Super  (16gb) which is an absurd 300 euros more expensive for what is issentially 4gb of vram. Therefore I want to ask you if you think that if you had 16gb you would run out of memory much less often, or if it is something you have to constantly battle with consumer grade hardware. Thanks for answers so far btw :)",
        "Yeah that seems like the case, I get what you mean, I might just choose a lower end card with 12Gb and offload the training as well. \n\nThanks for answering :)",
        "Yep it's mostly 2d 512x512 rgb images, more like proof of concept than actual production ready models",
        "I don’t think you’ll commonly need that much. You will hit the limit while adjusting and dialing in the model. You can lower batch size.. but ultimately it comes down to the number of parameters and loss complexity and resolution of the images. I think it’s unlikely you will have so much training data and model complexity that you’ll need 4 more gb but not more. \n\nAnd realistically you’ll be doing it from like 9 or 10 once you have the CUDA setup and environment and all that. \n\nJust save the money and use it for when you have something awesome and ready then spend a fraction of it training in the cloud.",
        "Yeah that seems very reasonable, but it's just that at the moment I don't even have a prototyping card. I am one of those people that believed Rocm would actually come to the Rx 6000 cards and bought in way in advance an rx6800xt which is now completely useless for this task. \n\nTherefore I'm just looking to sell my card and get a new one for around the same price, which would be the 4070 Super. But yeah it seems like it's much better to save the extra 300 and use that money for training"

One of the most common export formats is ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange). Converting to ONNX optimizes the model to utilize the capabilities of the deployment platform effectively. These can include Intel CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs, and even AMD GPUs with ROCm capability. However, getting started with converting models to ONNX can be challenging, even more so when using the converted model for inference. In this article, we will simplify the process. We will **export a custom PyTorch object detection model to ONNX**. Not only that, but we will also learn how to use the exported ONNX model for inference with CUDA support.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a4jglqk41vpd1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=676140a8dc40736bf37ce7dce7236744b682d9a1\n\n",

I've never worked with 3D images before\n2. If I were to use a pre-trained model, I'm not sure if PyTorch even has some (3D that is)\n3. I have my dataset, and I can already tell that using 3D images makes it quite a bit harder (at least for me anyways).\n\nMy dataset consists of approximately 820 samples, so quite small with respect to Deep Learning models. This is why I'm looking at optimizing a pre-trained model. If it was 2D images it much be much more straightforward. \n\nI've did a bit of searching around and I have found several resources that I will mention here and maybe someone reading might have even used some of them? What are your thoughts?\n\nWhat I have found thus far:\n\n* [timm\\_3D](https://github.com/ZFTurbo/timm_3d)\n* [MedicalNet](https://github.com/Tencent/MedicalNet/tree/master)\n* What if, for example using the ResNet50 2D model, changed the model architecture Conv2d -> Conv3d, and then for this newly added dimension I essentially replicate the pre-trained weights across. To break it down even more. For 2D images you have 1 Image HxW but for the 3D MRI images you have DxHxW where d is the depth which are the image slices, you could have lets say 80 of them. That would mean for the updated architecture I would copy the 2D ResNet weights 80 times for each slice. This might not even make sense, I only thought about it in my head.\n\n  \nOther information that might be useful:\n\nFile format is .dcm, As of now it is binary classification (I could get more data and other labeled data to make it 3-4 classes instead of 2).\n\nStill in the early stages of the project for Uni but just trying to think on how I'm going to approach it.\n\nAny feedback or comments is very much appreciated!",

Train auto encoder/décoder as a model that compresses the input and then reconstructs.\n Use the the first half, the encoder, which has now been trained as to construct an informative latent space, and use this to create the feature spaces that can be directly fed to layers in ur pretrained model. \n\nThis way ur encoding is highly informative prior to fine tuning end-to-end",

Despite feeling very similar to normal datasets, the fact that time is involved makes data processing/feature engineering/overall approach much more different than you might expect.\n\nAlso idk if your model is working/not, but having accurate first predictions could be indication of system \"learning\" but the system you are predicting could be too chaotic - this is more theoretical, and most likely something is broken on the practical part, but I don't rule out anything anymore :D\n\nAlternatively, you can try creating custom loss - think about it, MSE wouldn't be good for lets say price prediction - when you are trading, you are doing that with money.

Words are represented as learnable embeddings 512 dimension. If you just use correlation or dot-product between two words to show their contextual relation in a sentence, then it won't work. For instance, ' Dog is eating meat, because it is tasty' and 'Dog is eating meat because it is hungry'.  ''It' attends to meat in former sentence and to dog in later sentence. But simple dot product of word embeddings will give you same values for all these sentences.   \nhence to find the attention of 'it' to other words - Query transformed 'it' is used  to dot product with 'key' transformed representation of other words",

    "title": "Scaling - Inferencing 8B & Training 405B models",
    "selftext": "Thanks for being an awesome community!\n\nI have been trying to find guides to Scale training / inference setups for bigger models but I couldn't find anything that isn't handwavy when it comes to the nitty gritties of training. It'll be very helpful if you can share any guides or help with the answers (or partial answers) to my questions. I hope this will help others looking to scale their training/inference setup.\n\nSetup: I have two 24GB VRAM (7900XTX) with 128GB RAM/ AMD 7900X, one on each of the two nodes connected with Infiniband. I am experimenting with Llama 3.1 8B model (not quantized).\n\nCurrent State: When I load the 8B model onto GPU, I see 16GB Allocated/16GB Reserved\n\n1. Using FSDP (FULL\\_SHARD) to split the model still shows 8GB Allocated /16GB Reserved.a) Why is the full 16GB Reserved? Is it to transfer layers from other shards?b) Is there a way to manually manage that Reserve?c) FULL\\_SHARD takes 100x time to process the same requests (likely due to network constraints). 5 prompts took 30 seconds without Sharding but 3000 with FULL\\_SHARD and 40Gbps Infiniband.\n2. Without using any distributed techniques, the model takes up 16GB VRAM and adding \"-max\\_seq\\_len 8000\" pre-allocates/reserves another 6GB VRAM. However, when I do give it a prompt of 7000 tokens, it throws CUDA OOM, even after pre-allocating.a) Is it because the pre-allocation is done for the \"mean\" prompt length estimation?b) How would one scale this inference setup beyond that CUDA OOM limit on 24 GB cards (even if someone has a 100 24GB Cards?)? All the queries work fine with \"-max\\_seq\\_len 5000\" setting (if the prompt is longer, it just says out of token).c) Does anyone ever achieve beyond 20K tokens in semi-commercial setting? I can't see how anyone would reach 128K tokens.\n3. How would one go about inferencing a bigger model like the 70B model? I'd think FSDP type framework is needed but it would be terribly slow even on 100Gbps cards.\n4. What is the training setup like for the bigger 405B models?a) Even if we use FSDP, factoring in the VRAM needed for Grads and Optimizer States and network limitations, I find it very hard to process trillions of tokens in any reasonable time, considering the network would likely be an O(n\\^2) constraint with n being the number of layers sharded. I feel like I'm missing something.b) Even if Network wasn't an issue, how would we fit 128K tokens on a card \\*after\\* loading the shards? For example, if the shards alone end up taking 60-70% of the memory, how are we to make space for even 10K or 20K tokens (let alone 128K tokens). Seems to me like this would end up being an issue with H100 Cards as well for Trillion Parameter models (MoE or not).\n\nI am in the process of expanding my setup by adding 10 7900 XTX setup but I really wanted to figure out these details before I proceed with the purchases.

My dataset consists of 5 classes: windshield, driver, passenger, seat belt, and mobile phone. However, the dataset is imbalanced since not every image contains a seat belt or a mobile phone, with the mobile phone class being especially underrepresented.\n\n**Here's what I've done so far:**\n\n1. I trained the model initially using the following setup (epochs=100):\n2. )\n\nThe training and validation results were:\n\n* **mAP50(B)**: 0.90227\n* **mAP50-95(B)**: 0.6091\n* **Precision(B)**: 0.94716\n* **Recall(B)**: 0.85519\n* **Validation losses**:\n   * Box loss: 1.00115\n   * Class loss: 0.43317\n   * DFL loss: 1.33904\n\nDespite some promising results, the model didn't seem to fully converge, as the mAP on the validation set continued to show a slight upward trend.\n\n2. To address the class imbalance issue, I added weights for the underrepresented mobile phone class and increased the number of epochs to 200. I also added a cosine learning rate decay scheduler for more effective learning rate adjustment. My updated training configuration:\n\n        model.train( data=\"full\\_dataset/data/data1.yml\",  \n        imgsz=640,  \n        epochs=200,  \n        batch=16,  \n        workers=4,  \n        optimizer='SGD',  \n        lr0=0.01, lrf=0.001, momentum=0.937,  \n        weight\\_decay=0.0005,  \n        project=\"SeatBeltMobileDetection\",  \n        name=\"YOLOv5s\\_SGD\\_001\\_640\\_epochs200\",  \n        device=0,  \n        amp=True, warmup\\_epochs = 3.0, cos\\_lr = True   # Use cosine learning rate decay schedule ) \n\nAfter 200 epochs, the results were:\n\n* **mAP50(B)**: 0.91613\n* **mAP50-95(B)**: 0.61823\n* **Precision(B)**: 0.96231\n* **Recall(B)**: 0.86289\n* **Validation losses**:\n   * Box loss: 1.01821\n   * Class loss: 0.43639\n   * DFL loss: 1.40781\n\nThe model seems to have converged at this point, as the mAP metrics have stabilized and there’s less fluctuation compared to the 100-epoch run.\n\n**My questions:**\n\n1. Given the relatively small improvement between 100 and 200 epochs (particularly in mAP50-95), should I continue fine-tuning the model? If so, what steps would you recommend next?\n2. I’m considering adding more epochs or adjusting other parameters like learning rate, but I’m not sure if this will yield significant improvements at this stage. Any advice on how to approach further tuning?\n3. Is the relatively higher validation loss (especially the DFL loss) something I should be concerned about, or is this expected with my current setup?\n\nAny guidance or tips on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance!",

        ">How do I know which one to take ?\n\nYou don't, you play around with different ideas, and overtime, depending on your foundations and how well you understand your own data/model, you develop a sort of intuition of what would make sense to attempt. Other people's expertise is useless without knowing more about your model and data.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, if we're only talking about poor raw accuracy (which most of the time doesn't tell the whole story), and assuming you have played around with the hyperparameters, then the model architecture might not be a good fit. Again, we don't know anything about your model and data to give you advice on how to modify the architecture. \n\nData augmentation won't necessarily improve your model. It potentially helps with overfitting *if* it's applied judiciously. Poor data augmentation may introduce noises and further deteriorate performance. Models that heavily reply on augmented data may not translate to real world application performance.\n\nIn general:\n\n* Start by thoroughly understanding your data and current model performance.\n* If overfitting is observed and you have limited data, try data augmentation first.\n* If both training and validation performance are poor, consider adjusting the model architecture.\n* Always experiment with different approaches and monitor their impact on performance.\n* Develop intuition over time by analysing the results of your experiments."

They're not doing it to keep the prices of their other GPUs low, they're doing it to keep the profits of their other products high, not spending part of them on development of low-end nodes.",

There must be lots of RX 7600 dies that could have defective CUs fused-off and be sold as lower-end units.\n\nThis would align with AMDs apparent \"new\" focus on the low/midrange consumer GPUs after they have essentially conceded the ultra high-end to nVidia.",
        "I certainly don’t use them, because consumer gaming graphics cards aren’t designed to fit into servers. I don’t know that anyone can authoritatively say that they aren’t used, but I’d hazard a guess that anyone with the funds to set up an AI data center would opt for server quality hardware rather than a bunch of workstations all plugged into a network switch. \n\nOr, in IASIP terms: “you haven’t thought of the heat, you bitch!”",

Their raytracing is worse, their FSR is hot garbage, and Rocm/HIP/whatever is still alpha software.\n\nAMD's new focus doesn't come because AMD is better price-to-performance in the low-midrange. It comes because AMDs management realized that even if they had faster and cheaper GPUs, the adoption is so low devs don't really care to develop for their platform. And if no one's developing, it doesn't matter what  AMD makes, because the consumer will never see it.\n\nSo, as of right now, what AMD is doing is simply trying its hardest to even be able to compete in any segment with Nvidia. Because at this point they're going the way of 3Dfx, which as we all know, ended up in bankruptcy and being sold off to nvidia.",

Same for DLSS, and CUDA is not relevant to gaming.\n\nIf you look at the Steam hardware survey, low/midrange dominates the chart.  A staggering 4.2% of gamers still run GTX 1650's, GTX 1060 at 3.5%!\n\nSo no, there is a huge opportunity for anyone that makes modern, budget GPUs to replace these ancient ones still in-use.",
        "Consumer CPUs are irrelevant for deep learning.\n\nRTX, DLSS or CUDA don't mean anything by themselves, but they ARE relevant when you take into account that, if Steam surveys are representative, 77% of gamers own an Nvidia GPU. That means that every single piece of technology Intel and AMD make are tested against this 77%. And no developer is going to implement an Intel or AMD solution that Nvidia has without implementing it for nvidia. But if nvidia is already 77% of the market, then it might not even be worthwhile catering to the other 23% for such niche technology, or as you claim - irrelevant. Because if people want raytracing, they don't buy AMD, they buy nvidia, and they don't buy a 4050, they buy at least a 4060, if not a high end part.\n\nWhat people run individually doesn't matter, especially on the low end, because this doesn't spare or introduce more effort. Developers don't have to develop separately for the low-end GPUs. And so low end GPUs don't really steer anything in any direction because developing for them is just a byproduct of developing for the actual platform you're hitting. Developers don't develop their software for the minimum requirements.\n\nThe opportunity might be there, yet it might not be. Why? Because if nvidia can make a mid-end GPU that performs like an AMD or Intel high-end part, people are going to buy that. No one is going to upgrade over small performance uplifts unless support for something is dropping. That is what happens in practice, as well. That's why people pay 50-100$ more for an nvidia part. Because they offer premium at a small premium, and no one is so broke that they can't afford 50-100$ more.",

You take an application from fairly platform-agnostic toolset (Unreal, Unity, etc.) and *port* it to another platform.\n\nThe issues with most AAA console ports is that the fine-tuning and *optimization* required to target the PC platform is commonly rushed and/or done to an absolute minimum.",

Maybe the bias in data messes w/ the network?\n\n5) Might be converging to a local minima, maybe different optimizer/hyper-params help?\n\n6) Speaking of imbalanced classes, try to use f1/some other metric that's more robust to imbalanced classes?\n\n7) Have you checked the distributions of values across different classes? They might overlap too much, which could require some clever statistical separation or a different/layered approach (Maybe dimensionality reduction mentioned in first point? PCA might actually work in this case?). I’m not sure if this makes complete sense, but I have a feeling that the statistical properties of the various labels could be the issue.\n\n8) What if you get rid of the noise label and instead augment the datasets with noise? I.e turn this into simpler binary classification problem, and try to simulate what noise what do in data by making your data more noisey instead? Maybe even just leave out the noise, see how it performs? Or introduce noise through layers, rather than data? My experience with adding noise is that it can be finicky.\n\nNot exactly in any order, but this is what comes to mind to try out without seeing more info, hope it helps <3",
        "Can you predict the weather with a 50 element vector? Probably not accurately.\n\nCan you classify the likelihood of a loan being paid back from a customer with 50 meaningful data points? Pretty easily.\n\nIt comes to down to how complex your problem is and how relevant your data.",
        "Can you share your training code/model architecture? Also, you can try posting in r/MLQuestions, you may get more answers.",
        "I really appreciate your response - loads of stuff for me to have a look at!! The data is smoothed by the image processing then normalised and thats about it. I am using classical techniques (eg find peaks, binarise and find transitions etc) but with more barcode variations en route I wondered if a ML model would make life easier than having to keep fixing edge cases with logic.",
        "You are welcome :) I wish I could be more specific, but alas.\n\nTbf my first instrinct in this case would be to embed this into higher dimensional space, and then cluster, and see how the data behaves/gets clustered. It will either work, or hopefully will show where exactly data being tricky-dicky. This might also help identify other barcode variations as they come (hopefully) or at least show that algo/ML approach will work better on that front (once again, without specifics I can only abstractly speculate here)\n\nThat being said I'm a hack, so that's just gut feel :)\n\nEDIT: Just had an idea - what if you do PCA first and then do dimensional expansion? Or maybe the other way around.\n\nIdea being PCA might filter out noise -> Expansion into higher dim space can show patterns that are not obvious between barcodes. I'm just not sure on the order here."

For example, for SGD not even 0.01 maximum learning rate is that high. But even for ADAM, which uses smaller learning rates, you have higher maximum learning rates.

        "Instead of specific technologies, you should have larger end-to-end projects that use a combination of technologies. One technology by itself, unintegrated with any real business use cases or any actual problem that you're solving is not that impressive, and more likely will just be seen as an artifact of learning.\n\nThink about larger problems you're trying to solve, and show how your project is able to solve some issues regarding the problem.\n\nReach out to large companies, startups, etc., go to career fairs at any universities near you in person, speak to people that are in your field and ask if they know any internships happening. You basically have to apply to many different things, and connect with others and collaborate in order to secure an internship.\n\nHackathons are a great way to find opportunities like internships with companies.",
        "Can you share idea(s) for such larger, more sophisticated project?",
        "So one way to think about it is think about the workflow for existing problems, and how people are doing it right now, if you can show that you are making something practically useful instead of a contrived solution to a problem nobody has, that's generally more impressive. Do you save someone time, energy, or offer some novel more powerful method? It's helpful to figure out some problems you are interested in first, and then trying to figure out how to use the tech to solve that, rather than focusing on the tech, and just finding random arbitrary problems.\n\nLet's say for instance that you found this AI agent framework: https://github.com/microsoft/autogen\n\nAnd you apply it for the creation of some kind of market research multi-agent backend with an interface that crawls through sites, and finds people's sentiments in youtube comments, reddit comments, etc., and then makes it really easy to use that for iterating on development of a user interface- that's something practical, usable, that combines multiple skills (from backend, frontend, and possibly deep learning depending on how you orchestrate it).\n\nThis is just an example, but it requires critiquing your initial ideas, thinking of things that businesses actually care about (hint: something that adds value to the bottom line), v.s. your own passions and interests (like for instance creating a 3D interactive game).\n\nAnother example could be, extracting AI architectures and generating code concepts from papers, and making a collaborative platform for you and your friends (at the start), to better collaborate on making neural networks, etc.\n\nI have quite a few ideas, but I think the best way is to find good problems: https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/business-problem - this is very generic, but it's a good starting off point. Just search in Google \"problems in X\", X could be supply chain, computer architecture, legal compliance, financial systems, materials design, literally any human subject. \n\nFor instance I found these problems about supply chain,\nhttps://www.netsuite.com/portal/resource/articles/erp/supply-chain-challenges.shtml\n\nYou could make an interface that connects supply and demand partners, or create a site that ranks the quality and trustworthiness of various suppliers based on weather data and geopolitical things.\n\nHere on this site, someone made this project initially to track insider information, and now it's become a lot bigger: https://www.quiverquant.com/\n\nJust find some important problem where there aren't that many great solutions, or existing solutions are too bulky, and find ways to streamline it. Figure out your core audience, who are you trying to convince to hire you? Are you writing CUDA TensorRT code so NVIDIA takes a liking to you? Are you trying to become a front end developer for Apple? Each field has different things they care about seeing in projects.\n\nIt's up to you to determine what kinds of projects you'll put energy into.",

One problem is, a hard attention policy needs to be really semantically accurate in order to work, as its non-trainable. Another problem is, the simplest accurate hard attention policy can still have something wrong with it, like self-reinforcement, overfitting, lack of exploration, etc. These kind of problems can be resolved in a lot of different ways, so its kind of hard to parse out generalized solutions, or justify specific ones.   \n  \nMeanwhile, soft attention policies often have the promise of being universal function approximation, so people don't worry about it over there (though they should).",

    "title": "How to Efficiently Store Pruned Weight Matrices in Practice?",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m currently working on pruning a neural network to make it more efficient by eliminating some connections (setting some weights to zero). However, I’m struggling with how to efficiently store these pruned weight matrices.\n\nI understand that PyTorch, for example, supports storing sparse matrices, which works by keeping track of the non-zero values and their corresponding indexes. But here’s my concern: doesn’t storing the indexes of the non-zero weights negate some of the space-saving benefits? For instance, if half of the matrix consists of non-zero values, wouldn’t the saved space be offset by the need to store the indexes of these values?\n\nAm I missing something about how pruning should work in practice, especially for cases where I have around 50% non-zero values in a matrix? How do you typically implement pruning in practice to actually save storage space? Any advice or suggestions on how to store these matrices efficiently would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nTL;DR: How do you efficiently store pruned weight matrices without losing the space savings due to storing indexes for the non-zero values?\n",

Most deep learning models, although capable of performing well when detecting large objects, perform relatively worse on small objects. Even more so, when we start to fine-tune an object detection model on a new dataset. In this tutorial, we will carry out UAV Small Object Detection. In short, we will train an object detection model on high-resolution aerial imagery which contains very small objects. This will be a nice challenge considering that we will deal with a very unique dataset.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7gkxvrbm1hod1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=6657bbc2b6a13c23c161136dde8cbbd260b621ae\n\n",

The features are all categorical.\n\nEssentially the  input is of the shape **(batch size, source sequence length, number of features)** and target is of shape **(batch size, target sequence length, number of features)**. \n\nMy approach -\n\nLet's say number of features = 4, and so I pass the appropriate sliced input (all batches, all sequences, each feature) into 4 nn.Embedding layers, and then concatenate them to form an input shape of **(batch\\_size, sequence length, 4 \\* number of features)**.\n\nThis is then passed to the transformer, and the output is passed through 4 Linear Layers mapping them to vocab sizes of each feature. I also compute CE loss for each of the 4 categorical features, sum them and then do a backward. This is basically a set up where I have \"4\" seq2seq models which share same weights, if that makes sense. It becomes a multi-label multi-class classification problem.\n\nDuring inference I have a greedy decoding setup, where my aim is to predict these 4 features at each timestep.\n\nI see that my model is not converging and while the loss decreases it stagnates.\n\nIssues - \n\n Is my approach correct? Am I using the right loss function?",

    "title": "Great Divide on LLMs Capabilites",
    "selftext": "There are primarily three sets of viewpoints about LLMs, let’s take a closer look at them.\n\n# Position I (Skepticism)\n\nA few scientists like Chomsky view LLMs as highly advanced statistical tools that don’t equate to intelligence at all. The viewpoint is that these machines have seen so much data they can just give responses to any question we might come up with. Mathematically, they have calculated conditional probability for every possible question we can come up with.\n\n**My viewpoint:** The flaw here might be an underestimation of the nuanced ways in which data modeling can mimic certain aspects of cognition, albeit not true understanding. How do we know even humans are not doing the same, we are constantly being fed data by our different senses. So, differentiating between understanding and mimicking an understanding might also need the development of some other type of intelligence.\n\nThis paper throws a lot of light on how much of LLM behavior can just be explained by N-gram statistical rules: [**Understanding Transformers via N-gram Statistics**](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2407.12034)\n\n# Position II (Hopeful Insight)\n\nIlya Sutskever (creator of ChatGPT) and Hinton seem to suggest that LLMs have developed internal models reflective of human experience. Their position is that, since the text on the internet is a representation of human thoughts and experience, and by being trained to predict the next token in this data, these models have somehow built an understanding of the human world and experience. They have become intelligent in a real sense or at least appear to be intelligent and have created world models as humans do.\n\n**My viewpoint:** This might overstate LLMs’ depth, mistaking complex data processing for genuine comprehension and overlooking the absence of conscious experience or self-awareness in these models. Also, if they have built these internal world models, then why do they fail miserably on some fairly simple tasks that should have been consistent with these internal world models?\n\n# Position III (Pragmatism)\n\nA lot of scientists like LeCun and Kambhampati see LLMs as powerful aids but not as entities possessing human-like intelligence or even something that is remotely close to human intelligence in terms of experience or internal world models. LLMs, while impressive in their memory and retrieval abilities, fall short in genuine reasoning and understanding. They believe that LLMs should not be anthropomorphized or mistaken for having human-like intelligence. They excel as “cognitive orthotics,” aiding in tasks like writing, but lack the deeper reasoning processes akin to humans’ **System 2** thinking.\n\n>\n\nLLMs resemble human System 1 (reflexive behavior) but lack a System 2 (deliberative reasoning) component. They don’t have the capacity for deep, deliberative reasoning and problem-solving from first principles.\n\nThey believe that future advancements in AI will rely on fundamentally different principles, and the emergence of AGI can’t be just achieved by scaling. Le Cun even went on to say, Don’t work on LLMs.\n\nMy viewpoint: A few components from all the developments around LLMs will definitely be a part of the next generational system. I don't know exactly what will make it to the future systems, but some remnants of past advancements will definitely be a part of it.\n\n>**Full Article:** [**https://medium.com/aiguys/why-gen-ai-boom-is-fading-and-whats-next-7f1363b92696?sk=aee5405548b16e815c83e72b895f53b2**](https://medium.com/aiguys/why-gen-ai-boom-is-fading-and-whats-next-7f1363b92696?sk=aee5405548b16e815c83e72b895f53b2)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d7zr15tgfrnd1.png?width=464&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf60d2e6f59cdf8c1701e9ad96cbf864fdf50111\n\nThanks",

        "May I ask the reason you must use contrastive loss for classification? Contrastive loss is good when you want to learn high quality embeddings in a well structured latent space. It’s helpful when the downstream task is complex and needs nice features. In the case of classification the features go into MLPs and that’s it. I don’t think contrastive loss would help much.\nAlso there are a lot of other factors that can affect performance, such as data and hyper parameters…",
        "Yeah\n\nAt the very least there is a disbalance, worst case scenario there is a conflict. Though I would first make sure that the CrossEntropy-only setup is not overfitting.",
        "When you mix CrossEntropy with Contrastive loss, it’s like trying to make a smoothie with pickles and ice cream—unexpected results! 🍦🥒",
        "Thanks for your reply. As you say,Contrastive loss can help model learn high quality embeddings,I think when embeddings performance better,the classification model will perform well.I just want to test contrastive loss in simple classification task first. Then,I aim to use Contrastive loss in Semi-Supervised、Domain Generation and so on.",
        "Thanks for you reply.I think the CrossEntropy-only setup haven't problem,I use the torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10 and 100，the train dataset and val dataset is get by the parameters train=True/False.Ah..About the disbalance and worst case scenario,Can you talk specifically. \n\nThe Contrastive loss I use has two types,typeA is the augment picture and itself is positive pair,other is negative.typeB is the same class augment picture and itself is positive pair,other classes picture is negative. In my expectation,When I use CE-loss + typeA contrastive loss,the performance is worse than CE-loss only,because it also drag same class pictures away from itself.And use CE-loss + typeB contrastive loss,the performance is better than CE-loss only,because it make the same class pictures closer.\n\n  \nHowever,In my experiment. In CIFAR10 test,CE-loss + typeA or typeB contrastive loss better than CE-loss only,In CIFAR100 test,CE-loss + typeA or typeB contrastive loss worse than CE-loss only,the typeB contrastive is better than typeA.![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|dizzy_face)",
        "There's nothing to talk about specifically. The disbalance depends on the model, data, hyperparameters etc. Worst case scenario just means that the combination of your losses lead to a bad heuristic, meaning your weights will move towards undesired values.\n\nYou should probably not sum the two losses - instead you should probably find different ways to apply them. I don't see why you'd need contrastive loss for CIFAR. Similar images are not expected to have similar classification scores. Classification is not an encoding or regression task.\n\nYou should at most apply contrastive loss to whatever goes into the classifier, the features the model head extracts, but not any classifier output or intermediary value.",
        "Yeah,What I apply contrastive loss to is the features which output from encoder and it will go into the classifier.",
        "Then it could just be the worst case scenario. In your case, I'd plot the two losses together. If they are both oscillating with the same frequency, that would be your worst case scenario, and then you know you have to either remove one or scale it down. Or if only one is oscillating, that means it needs to be removed or scaled up to a higher value.",

        "I have used a method which might help you, might not. Should be at least fast to test. The basic idea is that if you blur both the UNet output, and your target data, you can do something like Focal Loss, which is more tied to the image distribution than the output distribution.\n\nSo, you build a Statistical Head submodel, which is just a max and min pooling operation with their output concatenated. This down-sampling model is applied to both your target data, and the UNet output. This will give you something like a (40,40,2) target and output. Write a custom loss function, which is basically BCE with no reduction, giving a (batch\\_size,40,40,2) loss tensor. Apply the maximum function on the last axis; meaning for each region of the error tensor we only consider the error of the Max-channel, or Min-channel, whichever has more error. Average the remaining (batch\\_size, 40, 40) to a single value, and return that as the Batch's Loss.    \n  \nOnce the model is trained, or even during training, you can remove the statistical head and see the full-resolution 1-channel output. Eye balling your data as (256, 256), I recommend using a pooling size anywhere from 8 to 32, with a stride half of the pooling size.",

I come in peace and I will ask a question that is propably repeated ad nauseam, but hopefully with a somewhat original twist.\n\nI'm a first year PhD (going in to the second of the three years only phd duration). I work in the development and modeling of a particular type of memristor. One key point of my thesis would be to find the \"best\" implementation of said device to perform neuromorphic computing. My background is in semiconductors sciences so in terms of machine learning and such I'm not that well versed.\n\nIn order to find such best case application (realistically in my three years it would only be from a simulation pov)  I'm interested in understanding better how DNN, ANN, SNN even, work and all the new fancy stuff that I often find in literature (meta-learning, reservoir computing). I think understanding these points is the best  way to have a clue of what to do with my device.\n\nI'm a practical learner so I was interested in learn how these systems actually works by directly working on them. I've started to approach some keras/tensorflow to understand some of the concepts. Now I see that there are big debates on whether TF or Pytorch is a better bang for bucks in terms of spending time to learn how to use them.\n\nMoreover I' ve also see that there are some frameworks such as MemTorch (based on Pytorch) that kinda do what I would be more interested into doing : Implementing hardware characteristics into DL algorithms.\n\nSo the questions: Is my understanding correct that PyTorch would probably be a better choice to waste my time on? If yes do you have some book suggestion, that offers a hands on approach to learn from scratch (or anyway that well explains everything that happens and why up to reasonable level).\n\nThank you all!",

I’ve been working with Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab but want to reduce epoch times by utilizing my dedicated GPU directly on my system.\n\n**Here’s what I’ve done so far:**\n\n* Installed Visual Studio Community 2022 (for Nvidia CUDA).\n* Followed tutorials to install CUDA 12.4 and cuDNN.\n* Installed Miniconda 3.10, but it clashed with my existing Anaconda3 (Python 3.12). I had to uninstall both, but now I’m having trouble reinstalling Anaconda3 as I can’t access the console properly.\n\n**Issues I’m facing:**\n\n* Confused with environmental variables after multiple installs/uninstalls.\n* I’m not sure how to set up the GPU for Jupyter Notebook or VSCode using Anaconda3/Miniconda.\n* Considering a factory reset but hoping to avoid that.\n\nHas anyone else faced similar issues? I’d really appreciate any help or guidance! I need to get this up and running soon for my university projects.\n\nThanks in advance! 🙏",

No more scribbling or messy annotations; this tool lets you place text in a polished way with rounded rectangles and customizable styles.\n\n# What It Does:\n\n* **Text Overlays**: You can add text to your images with adjustable font size, color, and background.\n* **Bounding Boxes**: Draws clean, rounded bounding boxes around objects, making your annotations look professional.\n* **Adaptive Positioning**: Text positions intelligently adjust to stay within the image boundaries.\n\n# What’s Next:\n\nI’m working on introducing a method that automatically adapts the text size, margins, and other parameters based on the image dimensions. The idea is to make it even more flexible, so it’s perfectly readable no matter the image size. But other than this, it's already in working condition and ready to be tested!\n\n# Why You Should Care:\n\nIf you’re tired of messy, handwritten annotations or just want a more aesthetically pleasing way to add text to images, this tool is for you. It’s great for labeling objects, making instructional images, or even just adding some stylish text to your photos.\n\n# Try It Out:\n\nI’ve attached an image below showcasing what Textify can do. Would love to hear your thoughts and any suggestions on how to improve it!\n\nCheck out the project on GitHub: [Textify by SanjayR-26](https://github.com/SanjayR-26/Textify)\n\nLet’s make image annotations cleaner and easier—no more scribbling! 🖊️🚫",

Look at how well RAG works.\n\nThen you may move onto LangChain for iterative design and implementation. They have a lot of really nice components which lets you expedite the iterative process.\n\nFor the final product, it may depend on what you're looking for. Someone else who does more Open Source projects can help comment/figure this out for me.\n\nYou may be able to do document adding by implementing a front end too, but then you'd be doing the full stack and have a private/secret database.",
        "Hi u/Skylight_Chaser ,\n\nThank you for your thoughtful reply. For now, we are trying to educate ourselves on how our goal could theoretically be accomplished so we can create a roadmap and involve AI professionals with specific requests and questions.\n\nAs we are not programmers or AI developers, your clarification that RAG works best with text is very helpful. For our project, we envision incorporating textual data from vision documents created by multiple landscape architecture firms. This way, the AI-generated responses would reflect more thoughtful design proposals, rather than relying on random facts from its training data.\n\nWe’re also very interested in incorporating high-quality images of landscape architecture projects into the model. Ideally, firms would be able to use their own visual libraries to generate content in their distinct style. Additionally, we’re exploring the idea of linking public image databases, such as historical archives, to influence the generation of images and ensure they are more contextually relevant—for instance, reflecting specific architectural styles.\n\nThanks again for your insights. \n\nBest,  \nSimon"

I'm an absolute beginner to deep learning and even more of a beginner in training a model locally instead of on cloud services such as google colab. The dataset I am using to demonstrate this issue is a very small one, around 2800 images total between 5 classes of flowers, and epochs are 50. The issue is, recently, during training phase and even inference phase, the gpu clocks ramp up to full 2790 mhz and stays there for the entirety of training, instead of going up and down with the variance in GPU utilisation as it did before. Before, it used to hover between 750 to 1100 mhz for the same workload. These \"stuck max clocks\" during training are causing higher wattage than before. I don't have the exact figures from before because i did not foresee such behaviour to occur but the wattage is around double than before. The clocks come back down after training, other than one time when the gpu clocks got stuck at 2535 mhz during training and stayed there until I restarted the pc. I want to know if this is normal behaviour for the GPU for this workload, is this dynamically adjusted by the gpu itself according to the task at hand, is there an error on my part, or is there a deeper issue here. I am very open to suggestions, guidance and criticism. I have attached some of the relevant screenshots.",

That's not surprising if there are more features than neurons, but we show that it can occur even with more neurons than features.\n\nThis depends on the existence of sparsity pressure (i.e. pushing small values to 0), and in particular, we claimed that noise drawn from distributions with negative excess kurtosis (i.e. fat tails, such as the Bernoulli but not the Gaussian) would cause sparsity.\n\nThere was one loose end I wanted to resolve: we didn't actually show this for the uniform distribution, which does have excess kurtosis! That's why I decided to replicate our [experiments](https://github.com/tmychow/incidental-polysemanticity) with noise from the uniform distribution.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/se3mg4jqlhmd1.png?width=1346&format=png&auto=webp&s=5884deb8e90ddf0eefee2b936c40d875c0070c62\n\nAs expected, it induces sparsity much like the Bernoulli, but unlike the Gaussian!\n\nI thought people might like seeing a **video walkthrough of ML research in action**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9-hEwxVQfM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9-hEwxVQfM), albeit a short one!",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm currently a 3rd-year Computer Science Engineering student, and I've been passionate about entrepreneurship and machine learning since my first year. Here's a bit about my journey so far:\n\n**Programming Skills:** Intermediate-level Python.\n\n**Courses Completed:**\n- Machine Learning Specialization by Stanford on Coursera.\n- NLP Specialization by deeplearning.ai on Coursera.\n\n**Current Focus:** Preparing for the TensorFlow certification.\n\n**Projects:** I've worked on some simple projects using TensorFlow and NLP based on what I've learned so far.\n\n**Startup Idea:**\nMy country is facing a significant waste management problem, from collection to disposal. Despite increased government spending, the issue persists. My vision is to build an autonomous bot that collects waste throughout the streets, sweeping roads and picking up from designated points. This solution will assist existing workers, allowing them to focus more on beautifying our streets.\n\n**My Future Plan:**\n- Learn PyTorch\n- Explore OpenCV and ROS\n- Build a small-scale version of the bot using Arduino\n- Pitch this idea as a startup and seek a co-founder\n\nI am well aware of the need for Lidar and Automobile Engineers in this project and my startup. Machine learning or deep learning is the only way I believe I can showcase my idea and pitch it strongly enough to convince them to join my venture. That's why I'm committed to learning all of this.\n\nHow do you think about this approach? Any insights or advice would be greatly appreciated!",

        "Is this a mini robot like the ones delivering food? You should look into those and see the difficulties that come with autonomous robotics out on the streets, it is a very difficult task, especially now that you want to include object detection and could have potential liability issues (how do you make sure you don't throw out a wallet/watch or a store's display by accident). A very interesting idea for sure though! Good luck",
        "I don't really think the tensorflow certification will help. But nonetheless it's a good idea so I will not be too skeptical about it, try it!",
        "I admire your aspiration but I don’t think you realise quite how insanely big of a task this would be. Programming will be like 1% of the challenge here."

    "selftext": "Event-based object localized recognition models can be simply seen as a typical spatio-temporal model that pays attention in recognizing localized events amongst multiple events happening simultaneously.Most event-based action recognition are spatio-temporal models that addresses a collective action of events happening simultaneouly as a group of event, it become a much more difficult spatial-model when the model needs to go beyond identifying group action but identifying localized actions. Things have gotten a little better as convolutional architectures are replaced with self-attention (transformers). Thereby making computation faster, accurate and more intuitive.For instance, typical space-time self attention model like, TimesFormer, have been trained on state of the art data like the kinetic-400,600. TimesFormer have proven to be fast and great for video classification, as it benches slowfast and I3D models.Moreover, localization of temporal events amongst group events happening simultaneously is still a challenge AI researchers in this field are trying to solve.Finally, if it's possible for us to have generative models that can intuitively generate video streams in details then we can reverse-engineer such transformer architectures to solve the problem of event localization amongst group events.",

Are Agents just enhanced reasoning? The answer is yes and no. Yes, in the sense that agents have simple rules and can sometimes enhance reasoning capabilities compared to a single prompt. But No in the sense that agents can have a much more diverse functionality like using specific tools, summarizing, or even following a particular style. In this blog, we look into how to set up these agents in a hierarchal manner just like running a small team of Authors, researchers, and supervisors.\n\n[**How To Build Hierarchical Multi-Agent Systems?**](https://medium.com/aiguys/how-to-build-hierarchical-multi-agent-systems-dc26b19201d2?sk=90958e39e1a28f5030872a90f8e3f3da)\n\n**TextGrad**. It is a powerful framework performing automatic “differentiation” via text. **It backpropagates textual feedback provided by LLMs to improve individual components of a compound AI system.** In this framework, LLMs provide rich, general, natural language suggestions to optimize variables in computation graphs, ranging from code snippets to molecular structures. TextGrad showed effectiveness and generality across various applications, from question-answering and molecule optimization to radiotherapy treatment planning.\n\n[**TextGrad: Improving Prompting Using AutoGrad**](https://medium.com/aiguys/textgrad-controlling-llm-behavior-via-text-2a82e2073d10?sk=3633a9aa63b884c97469bce659265921)\n\nThe addition of RAG to LLMs was an excellent idea. It helped the LLMs to become more specific and individualized. Adding new components to any system leads to more interactions and its own sets of problems. Adding RAG to LLMs leads to several problems such as how to retrieve the best content, what type of prompt to write, and many more.\n\nIn this blog, we are going to combine the **LangChain RAG with DSPy**. We deep dive into how to evaluate the RAG pipeline quantitatively using **RAGAs** and how to create a system where instead of manually tweaking prompts, we let the system figure out the best prompt.\n\n[**How To Build LangChain RAG With DSPy?**](https://medium.com/aiguys/how-to-build-langchain-rag-with-dspy-ce9154fbafaa?sk=b41d10405f84c767cf9cd6a58d1ebac0)\n\nAs the field of natural language processing (NLP) advances, the evaluation of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 becomes increasingly important and complex. Traditional metrics such as accuracy are often inadequate for assessing these models’ performance because they fail to capture the nuances of human language. In this article, we will explore why evaluating LLMs is challenging and discuss effective methods like BLEU and ROUGE for a more comprehensive evaluation.\n\n[**The Challenges of Evaluating Large Language Models**](https://medium.com/aiguys/the-challenges-of-evaluating-large-language-models-ec2eb834a349)\n\n# AI Monthly News\n\n# AI Act enters into force\n\nOn 1 August 2024, the European Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act) enters into force. The Act aims to foster responsible artificial intelligence development and deployment in the EU. The AI Act introduces a uniform framework across all EU countries, based on a forward-looking definition of AI and a risk-based approach:\n\n* **Minimal risk:** most AI systems such as spam filters and AI-enabled video games face no obligation under the AI Act, but companies can voluntarily adopt additional codes of conduct.\n* **Specific transparency risk:** systems like chatbots must clearly inform users that they are interacting with a machine, while certain AI-generated content must be labelled as such.\n* **High risk:** high-risk AI systems such as AI-based medical software or AI systems used for recruitment must comply with strict requirements, including risk-mitigation systems, high-quality of data sets, clear user information, human oversight, etc.\n* **Unacceptable risk:** for example, AI systems that allow “social scoring” by governments or companies are considered a clear threat to people’s fundamental rights and are therefore banned.\n\n**EU announcement:** [**Click here**](https://commission.europa.eu/news/ai-act-enters-force-2024-08-01_en)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nwyzfzgm4cmd1.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=c873db37ca0dadd5b510bea70ac9f633b96aaea4\n\n# California AI bill SB-1047 sparks fierce debate, Senator likens it to ‘Jets vs. Sharks’ feud\n\n**Key Aspects of SB-1047:**\n\n* Regulation Scope: Targets “frontier” AI models, defined by their immense computational training requirements (over 10²⁶ operations) or significant financial investment (>$100 million).\n* Compliance Requirements: Developers must implement safety protocols, including the ability to immediately shut down, cybersecurity measures, and risk assessments, before model deployment.\n* Whistleblower Protections: Encourages reporting of non-compliance or risks by offering protection against retaliation.\n* Safety Incident Reporting: Mandates reporting AI safety incidents within 72 hours to a newly established Frontier Model Division.\n* Certification: Developers need to certify compliance, potentially under penalty of perjury in earlier drafts, though amendments might have altered this.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* Safety First: Prioritizes the prevention of catastrophic harms by enforcing rigorous safety standards, potentially safeguarding against AI misuse or malfunction.\n* Incentivizes Responsible Development: By setting high standards for AI model training, the company encourages developers to think critically about the implications of their creations.\n* Public Trust: Enhances public confidence in AI by ensuring transparency and accountability in the development process.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* Innovation Stagnation: Critics argue it might stifle innovation, especially in open-source AI, due to the high costs and regulatory burdens of compliance.\n* Ambiguity: Some definitions and requirements might be too specific or broad, leading to legal challenges or unintended consequences.\n* Global Competitiveness: There’s concern that such regulations could push AI development outside California or the U.S., benefiting other nations without similar restrictions.\n* Implementation Challenges: The practicalities of enforcing such regulations, especially the “positive safety determination,” could be complex and contentious.\n\n**News Article:** [**Click here**](https://www.thenation.com/article/society/sb-1047-ai-big-tech-fight/)\n\n**Open Letter:** [**Click here**](https://safesecureai.org/open-letter)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ib96d7nk4cmd1.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ed5913b5dae72e203c8592393e469d9130ed689\n\n# MORE OpenAI drama\n\nOpenAI co-founder John Schulman has left the company to join rival AI startup Anthropic, while OpenAI president and co-founder Greg Brockman is taking an extended leave until the end of the year. Schulman, who played a key role in creating the AI-powered chatbot platform ChatGPT and led OpenAI’s alignment science efforts, stated his move was driven by a desire to focus more on AI alignment and hands-on technical work. Peter Deng, a product manager who joined OpenAI last year, has also left the company. With these departures, only three of OpenAI’s original 11 founders remain: CEO Sam Altman, Brockman, and Wojciech Zaremba, lead of language and code generation.\n\n**News Article:** [**Click here**](https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/05/openai-co-founder-leaves-for-anthropic/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0vdjc18j4cmd1.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9de604c26aed3e47b50df3bdf114ef61f967080\n\n# Apple and Nvidia may invest in OpenAI\n\nApple, which is planning to integrate ChatGPT into iOS, is in talks to invest. Soon after, [*Bloomberg* also](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-29/nvidia-has-held-discussions-about-joining-openai-s-funding-round?srnd=homepage-americas) reported that Apple is in talks but added that Nvidia “has discussed” joining the funding round as well.

        "Sorry but what is that 'research' question??",
        "Hey, apologies if I'm missing something, but when would NOT tuning the hyper-parameters ever give better performance? If the default setting of the parameters is optimal (very rare), then you'll find the same setting after tuning (provided you explore that particular configuration). But if it's not, tuning them will only give better performance. So there's really no setting where not tuning gives better performance than tuning.\n\nFurthermore, grid search just involves looping over different hyper-parameter settings and training/testing. If you can code up everything else, this just involves wrapping the main code in a loop. But (putting performance aside as it's addressed above), if you're looking into efficiency, then random search has been shown to lead to a better exploration of the hyper-parameter space than grid search, for the same computational cost, so you might want to look into that instead.\n\nBut this trade-off is well studied in ML and has been for several years. So I'll echo a different comment asking what the research question actually is?",

        "I wasn’t criticizing you, just laughing about the fact that this is very much not a MS level question.",
        "No worries I understand.   \n  \nI agree, with you he should have studied harder, he's probably in meltdown because his deadline is so close.   \n  \nI was hinting if he was stuck he could ask an LLM rather than embarrass himself on Reddit."

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nTogether with a group of designers, researchers and journalists we are working in a publication on the Application of AI for Planning and Climate Adaptation (SCAPE magazine).\n\nWhile diving into the topic, we have started wondering: how will less profitable and more activist fields like landscape architecture or nature conservation be able to develop their own AI systems? And how would be the best approach to make them not only efficient but also to work within the same values of openness, collaboration and sustainability that we share, and we do not see in current available models.\n\nInspiring initiatives in other fields make us think that there is another way around Big Tech corporations, and we would like to understand the developer perspective on it.\n\nWe are happy to hear any opinions, discussions, strategic advices, development tips or any other remark shared that you think is essential for developing, deploying and maintaining such an open source AI system for Landscape Architecture.\n\nFor context, as Landscape Architects, our work is quite broad, from designing green public spaces for cities, to developing city level planning focused on greener, walkable and climate adaptive neighborhoods, to larger regional plans focused on nature and floodplain restoration.\n\nIn the field of landscape architecture the emergence of the computer and internet changed the profession, and not always for good. We can see the risks of ai, pushing landscape architects to more generic design, quick visual output, efficiency, low cost, etcetera. At the same time we see the opportunity of integrating ever improving climate models, ecology mapping, better understanding how to manipulate the landscape to optimize biodiversity and climate adaptivity. But what about the things that are hard to digitalise? Word to mouth stories, soft values, local culture, local history, seasonality, atmosphere, etcetera? Exactly because landscape architecture is not a very large/profitable market, it’s not likely commercial companies will jump on this. We think it’s worth developing/training an AI for local soft values - run on a solar/hydro powered datacenter. With universities - but we’d need a larger community to make it work.\n\nThank you in advance for any answer – we will link to this post and fully cite you in the magazine for all the information shared,\n\nAnd hopefully we can build a collective view on this,\n\nBest,\n\nSimon",

    "title": "5 Gs of Geometric Deep Learning: Graphs, Grids, Groups, Geodesics, and Gauges",
    "selftext": "Do you want to know why Deep Learning works so well, what are its mathematical underpinnings? Then look no further than **Symmetry**.\n\n**Graphs**\n\nImagine trying to understand a social network or predict the properties of a complex molecule using traditional neural networks. It’s like trying to solve a 3D puzzle with 2D tools. This is where Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) come into play. By representing data as nodes and edges, GNNs can capture intricate relationships that flat data structures miss.\n\nFor instance, in drug discovery, GNNs can model molecules as graphs, with atoms as nodes and bonds as edges. This approach has led to breakthroughs in predicting molecular properties and designing new drugs. However, it’s not all smooth sailing. The irregular structure of graphs can make computations more complex and time-consuming compared to traditional neural networks.\n\n**Grids**\n\nWhen we think about computer vision, image recognition is the first that comes to our mind. As explained above as well Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) operate on grid-like structures. The regular arrangement of pixels in images allows CNNs to efficiently learn hierarchical features, from simple edges to complex objects.\n\nBut here’s the catch: while grids work wonders for images and videos, they fall short when dealing with irregularly structured data. This limitation has pushed researchers to explore more flexible geometric approaches.\n\n**Groups**\n\nThink about this for a moment why does a neural network need to relearn what a cat looks like when the image is rotated? In a lot of vision pipelines, we add rotation and other types of symmetries to our data as part of data augmentation. Enter group-equivariant neural networks. By incorporating mathematical group theory, these networks can recognize objects regardless of rotation, translation, or other symmetries.\n\nThis approach isn’t just elegant; it’s efficient. It reduces the amount of data needed for training and improves generalization. However, implementing group equivariance for all possible symmetries can be computationally expensive, leading to a trade-off between invariance and efficiency.\n\n**Geodesics and Manifolds**\n\nIn the real world, data often doesn’t lie flat. Think of the surface of the Earth or the space of all possible human faces. This is where geodesics and manifolds come in. By understanding the intrinsic geometry of data, we can develop models that respect its true structure.\n\nManifold learning techniques like t-SNE and UMAP have revolutionized data visualization and dimensionality reduction. In deep learning, these concepts allow us to build models that can navigate the curved spaces of natural data. The challenge lies in balancing the complexity of these non-Euclidean approaches with computational feasibility.\n\n**Gauges and Bundles**\n\nAnd at last, into the realm of advanced mathematics are Gauges and bundles. These concepts are borrowed from differential geometry and theoretical physics, and now finding their way into deep learning. These methods allow us to build models that are consistent under complex local transformations of data.\n\nWhile this area is still largely theoretical, it holds promise for tackling problems in physics simulations and other domains where local symmetries are crucial. The main hurdle? The steep learning curve and computational complexity associated with these advanced mathematical structures.\n\nTo bridge all these different concepts, geometric graphs and meshes combine the relational power of graphs with spatial information. This approach is particularly powerful in 3D modeling, computer graphics, and physical simulations.\n\nImagine training a neural network to understand and manipulate 3D objects as easily as we do with 2D images today. That’s the promise of geometric deep learning on meshes. The challenge lies in developing efficient algorithms that can handle the increased complexity of these structures.\n\nThe applications of truly understanding these symmetries are endless, the next big thing that could potentially take us to AGI, might be a system that can handle all these transformations and symmetries in one single architecture.\n\n>**Full article:** [**https://medium.com/aiguys/geometric-deep-learning-introduction-46ff511e0bac?sk=636e58f285d5c5cf8b62cecfc832fcdd**](https://medium.com/aiguys/geometric-deep-learning-introduction-46ff511e0bac?sk=636e58f285d5c5cf8b62cecfc832fcdd)\n\nHere is a small list of which type of architecture exploits which type of symmetry.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e9mnri5ryjld1.png?width=781&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bac9a0a656cfb61f739fdabff441a48edf8f4df\n\n",

And these are in the order as they appear in time. \n\nI've noticed that some weeks can have 80000+ logs, and so as I scale the time to two weeks, etc. this sequence length would also scale.\n\nSo the questions I had were - \n1. If I used a sliding window, would the trade-off be that I have lesser context to predict rather than an entire week? \n2. Since ultimately my goal is to feed in a week's sequence of log IDs and get the next week, would sliding window still make sense as an approach?\n3. What would be the most efficient way to structure the sliding window?

Or is there a better approach to reconstruct small details? Please bear in mind that the network architecture should be relatively light and fast to train.\n\nThank you!",

        "Hi, so if you want to land a job where you use deep learning models (it seems to be what you are interested in), most of the time you'll need a PhD. At least that's the situation here in France. \nMost job offers advertised as \"machine learning engineer\", you'll be dealing with simple machine learning models such as xgboost, regressions etc. \nAnd probably spend way more time on data collecting and cleaning.\nSo just be aware that if you want to do a Master's then find a job, that's probably this type of job that you'll be offered. \n\nYou're biased by big headlines but the reality of the job market is that there are still a lot of openings, a lot of big companies want to use machine learning and are only starting to recruit for it.\n\nNow as the other guy said, if you really want to do modern machine learning, you'll have to do a PhD. \nSo the advice is: don't worry about the job market, it will probably change a lot more in the coming years, before you even end your PhD.\nI think it's the safest choice because you'll be able to land both traditional machine learning positions as detailed above, but also the \"research\" stuff.\n\nThe very nice thing is that you have already done a lot of machine learning related things and you're just finishing your bachelor. I personally only picked up this stuff during my Master's, and really diving into it since the beginning of my PhD.\n\nHope this helps :)\n\nEdit: ah and yes I think now that you have a very good grasp of the basics by following the different courses you mentioned, it's time to really dive in the details. This means reading papers, this also means reading about everything that you don't understand when reading a paper. Ultimately, this means studying a lot of maths, so if possible take these classes.

However, I noticed the inclusion of AlphaZero. My understanding of RL is that the general framework is around solving a Markov Decision Process (for example, as described here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement\\_learning). However, 2 (or more) player games don't really fit under this framework. If you model the opponent as part of the environment, then the environment is unknown and potentially time-varying, and thus very difficult to solve. Otherwise, there seems to be no way to model a game with a MDP. It seems to me that this is an entirely separate domain, e.g. we cannot standard RL techniques like PPO or DDPG to a 2-player game, is this correct? Also, what is the more umbrella definition of RL, if not solving MDPs?",

The data that I have, solely consists of positive user and content interactions. (i.e. I do not have any data for scenarios when an user ignored the content that was presented). \n\nI am struggling with the following implementation details.\n\n1. In-batch negative sampling seems a popular method for training the candidate generation phase. In a batch an user Ui and content Cj is treated as a negative sample if 'i' is not equal to 'j'. But if a batch has multiple interaction records for a specific user, in-batch negative sampling could lead to conflicting training data for the model. How do we handle the issue? Do we need to ensure that each batch has only a single interaction record for a given user?\n\n2. If I want to measure the model performance in the validation set (or want to use early stopping), how do  I generate negative samples for the validation set. I can use the same methodology as in-batch sampling. But I will run into the same problem of multiple interactions for a given user. \n\n3. Could you please recommend a good way to split the data into training and validation set? Should I ensure that I have a set of users and all their interactions only in the validation set. i.e. for those users there are no interactions in the training set\n\nAny inputs and suggestion would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you!",

        "I'm working on a similar project right now. In my case the users order food from specific restaurants.\n\n1. There are two general approaches to solve this issue. The first one is called logQ correction, the idea is the following:\n\n`logQ_values = {k: np.log(1 + v) for k, v in data['brand_id'].value_counts().to_dict().items()}`\n\n`outputs = torch.sum(user_embeddings * item_embeddings, dim=1)`\n\n`logQ_batch = torch.tensor([logQ_values[brand.item()] for brand in brands], dtype=torch.float32).to(device)`\n\n`outputs = outputs - lambda_ * logQ_batch`\n\nYou can read about it, for example, here: [https://www.uber.com/en-DE/blog/innovative-recommendation-applications-using-two-tower-embeddings/](https://www.uber.com/en-DE/blog/innovative-recommendation-applications-using-two-tower-embeddings/) in the section \"LogQ Correction for In-batch Negatives\"\n\nWe calculate the logs of values of the counts of the items and then subtract them from the prediction scores.\n\nAnother approach is to take not the list of the brands in the batch, but the set - in this case, there won't be repeats of the same brand.\n\n  \n2. You need to imitate the real situation, so you need to take all the relevant candidates. This would mean that you take the user and all the items and calculate the metrics on them\n\n3. I'd suggest to imitate the real situation again - do a time-based split. For example, take 1-3 weeks of data for training and use the next week for validation.",

    "selftext": "I am working on a medical dataset which consist of baseline CT scans and time to event (disease occurance) or follow up time (maximum time for which the subject was monitored in the study with no occurance of disease). There are also some subjects which left the study due to death (from some other condition) and are hence censored. My interest lies in identifying the cases which develops the disease in a short interval after the baseline scan, as they can be provided medication to manage the disease progression. My initial attempt was to phrase the problem as a binary classification task i.e to classify whether the subject will develop the disease within a fixed time interval, say 10 years. There are two reasons behind chosing such a large interval: the disease progression takes time, and we will have a bigger cohort of postive cases. This gives about 3 positive case for every 100 negative cases. The model is trained using a binary cross entropy loss and I achieve a desent auroc score of 80 percent uisng a 4 fold cross validation.\n\nHowever, there is a problem that the model gets no information regarding the difference in time of event, i.e. a subject developing the disease in the first year after the baseline scan will be treated the same way as the one which develops the disease in the 9 year. On the other hand, a subject which develops the disease in the 11th year will be negative. Hence, in order to utilise this information in improving the model training, I employed another approach in which I use a multi-output model, which essentially done by setting the fully connected layer to identity and defining two seperate layers for the two tasks: classification and regression. The ground truth contains a binary label: positive if the subject develops the disease in 10 years, and vice versa; and normalised time to event data: 1 for the earliest subject which develops the disease, 0 for those that never develops the disease or develops it after 10 years, every other subject is scaled accordingly, for example: 0.3 for those who developed in 7 years.\n\nMy initial attempt was to sum up or use weighted sum (50-50 for now) of BCE and MSE loss, however, training loss seems to increase instead of decreasing. In the second attempt, I used weighted BCE and MAPE (mean abs. percentage error), but this too gave dissapointing result. I am using all subjects (positve plus negative cases) for the BCE loss calculation whereas only the positive cases for the MSE/MAPE loss calculation.\n\nPlease suggest ideas for the loss defination to improvement in model training.

        "My first thought was why not train a single regression model and then threshold it with a value you want (10 in your case) to get your “second” classification model. You might even calculate the loss for classification and use combined loss for training although I am not sure if it is going to be of any help really. \nIf the accuracy is the issue, then you should be able to fine tune the regression model into a classification model easily. \n\nIf you want to stick to your approach, maybe the issue is that the regression task is too difficult to optimize, and regression loss is exploding. Maybe try the first suggestion to see if this is even possible.\nAnother reason might be that whatever you are using is doing the backward pass and parameters update incorrectly since the output is split for a single model. Try checking for that too.",
        "The problem with going solely with regression strategy is that the dataset has very few positive cases i.e. subject  who exeperience the disease in the 10 years. Also, I have to drop a lot of subjects because of censoring as they have followup time less that 10 years and hence we don't know whether they experience the event. Another problem is, the dataset doesn't meet the criteria for fitting to a regression problem, ie. not Gaussian distributed",
        "Then that’s probably the reason for increasing loss. \n\nWith the combined loss, can you try and see if the accuracy of the classifier part is at least decent? If not, then the problem is with the implementation. \n\nIf the idea for combining classification and regression is to ease the regression task, you should try training for classification and then finetuning for regression. \n\nInstead of regression you can try training several binary classifiers so that they predict if the patient gets disease in 1 year, 3 years, and so on."

McCulloch and Walter Pitts in 1943 \\[82\\]. Since this model had serious learning limitations, Frank Rosenblatt introduced the multilayer perceptron in 1959, endowed with better learning capabilities. Rosenblatt’s perceptron had an input layer of sensory units, hidden units called association units, and output units called response units. In fact, the perceptron was intended to be a pattern recognition device, and the association units correspond to feature or pattern detectors. The theory was published in his 1961 book, “Principles of neurodynamics: Perceptrons and the theory of brain mechanism”, but it was haunted by the lack of appreciation at the time due to its limitations, as pointed out in the book of Minsky and Papert \\[87\\]. \n\n**Learning in Rosenblatt’s multilayer perceptron is guaranteed by a convergence theorem, which assures learning in finite time.** However, in most cases this convergence is too slow, which represents a serious limitation of the method. This is the reason why the next learning algorithms involved a procedure introduced by Hadamard in as early as 1908, called the gradient descent method. Shunichi-Amari in his 1967 paper \\[3\\] describes the use of gradient descent methods for adaptive learning machine. The early use of the gradient descent method has been also employed by Kelley \\[62\\], Bryson \\[18\\], Dreyfus \\[33\\], etc., in the same time period. The previously described period lasting between 1940 and 1960 and dealing with theories inspired by biological learning is called cybernetics.",

    "selftext": "In short, I was working on some problems whose most degenerate forms can be linear. Hence I was able to reduce the non-converging cases to a very small linear regression problem that converges unreasonably slow with gradient descent.\n\nI was under the impression that while solving linear optimization with gradient descent is not the most efficient way, it should nonetheless converge quite quickly and be a practical way to solve linear problems (so that non-linearities can be seamlessly added later). Among other things, linear regression is considered a standard introductory problem to gradient descent. Also many NNs are piece-wise linear. Now instead, I start to question the nature of my reality.\n\nThe problem is to minimize ||Ax-B||\\^2 (that is to solve Ax=B) like follows.  \nThe loss starts at 100 and is expected to minimize to 0. Instead it converged impractically slow to be solvable with gradient descent.\n\n    import torch as t\n    \n    A = t.tensor([\n        [-2.4969e+02, -4.1511e+00],\n        [-4.1511e+00, -2.0755e-01]])\n    \n    B = t.tensor([-0., 10.])\n    \n    #trivially solvable by lstsq\n    x_solved = t.linalg.lstsq(A,B)\n    print(x_solved)\n    #solution=tensor([  1.2000, -72.1824])\n    print(\"check if Ax=B\", A@x_solved.solution-B)\n    \n    def forward(x_):\n        return (A@x_-B).pow(2).sum()\n    \n    #sanity check with the lstsq solution\n    print(\"loss computed with the lstsq solution\",forward(x_solved.solution))\n    \n    x = t.zeros(2,requires_grad=True)\n    #learning_rate = 1e-7 #converging to 99.20282745361328 at T=1000000\n    #learning_rate = 1e-6 #converging to 92.60104370117188 at T=1000000\n    learning_rate = 1e-5 #converging to 46.44608688354492 at T=1000000\n    #learning_rate = 1.603e-5 # converging to 29.044937133789062 at T=1000000\n    #learning_rate = 1.604e-5 # diverging\n    #learning_rate = 1.605e-5 # inf\n    #learning_rate = 1.61e-5 # NaN\n    for T in range(1000001):\n        loss = forward(x)\n        if T % 100 == 0:\n            print(T, loss.item(),end='\\r')\n        loss.backward()\n        with t.no_grad():\n            x -= learning_rate * x.grad\n            x.grad = None\n    print('converging to',loss.item(),f'at T={T} with lr={learning_rate}')\n\nI have already gone to extra lengths finding a good learning rate - for normal \"tuning\" one would only try values such as 1e-5 or 2e-6 rather than pinning down multiple digits just below the point of divergence.  \nI have also tried unrolling the expression and ultimately computing the derivatives symbolically, which seemed to suggest that the pytorch grad was correct - it would have been hard to imagine that pytorch today still has a bug manifesting in such a simple case anyway. On the other hand it really baffles me if mathematically gradient descent indeed has such a weakness. Not yet exhaustively, but none of the optimizers from torch.optim worked for me either.\n\nDid anyone know what I have encountered?",

        "I was able scale the stddev but not the mean, which indeed helped somewhat. On the other hand having to compute the matrix A explicitly (before being able to scale the rows) would sort of defeat the purpose of my original formulation for more complex cases.  \n  \nHowever it turned out that second order methods would work as I originally assumed - never realized that the performance of first and second order methods could differ so much, or why they are still not popular."

I'm trying to use ResNet50: my dataset is composed by more or less 12k medical images (already augmented) but I'm noticing an overfitting behaviour when I have all the backbone layers freezed (not trainable) and only one Dense with a sigmoid activation function. I thought that since my images domain is very different from imageNet maybe a good approach could be to remove some last convolutional pretrained layers and replace them with my dense layer and train only it: this beacuse the last layers contain high level features of imageNet dataset. Is this right in your opinion?\n\nDo you have any other suggestions? Thanks a lot in advance for your time!",

        "Instead of augmenting the minority class to balance the dataset, consider using class weights or oversampling strategy to counteract class imbalance. Also, if you augment only the minority class, the model might be biased towards the augmentations as it will associate the augmentations with the minority class.",

        "So your suggestion is to augment both the classes and use class weights? Thanks",
        "Hmmm weird. If you only have 2049 weights and that many images for a binary(?) classifier since you’re using sigmoid should be ok. \n\nAre you applying dropout between the frozen come layers and your dense to output layer? If not, maybe try that. If you are, and it’s still not working, I would check to see if something about freezing the middle layers makes the model think it’s in inference mode. If that isn’t working, maybe apply dropout to the frozen layers as if it’s in training mode but don’t do the backwards pass. If your dropout is too low, that might also be a problem. \n\nAnother thing would be to consider the breakdown of your two classes. If you have a severe imbalance with only a few examples of one class, it will be hard for the model to generalize. One way to approach it would be to weight the observations by class so that the total sample weight is roughly equal. Another, perhaps crazier idea would be to try to bootstrap your way to a synthetic dataset using one of the image gen models (you said augmented so I’m assuming flips and rotations and some noise added or something like that). \n\nYou could also look at lowering your learning rate in conjunction with any of these suggestions. My intuition would be that if you’re freezing the output of the middle layers and only training the last layers, you might be getting wild swings in your last layers that lead you to a steep minimum that might not be either particularly flat or global. So you could look at your gradients for an epoch or a few batches. You might even check the Hessian to see how flat your minimum is.",
        "yeah, I would say so. Tbh, I find it strange that you are getting any meaningful result with you strategy of augmenting only the minority class.

A slice is very very similar to the following and so on and maybe the model overfits because there are a loss of generality: a lot of very very similar images that are interpreted as the same images maybe. I’m thinking to apply a layer of random transformation before the network input in order to augment the variability of the dataset. What do you think?",
        "Good luck!",
        "Well that’s not too bad. But if there’s a really big imbalance in the underlying distributions that could be an issue given your current sample size, e.g., 10% of 7.5K is only 750 images going into 2K weights.",

        "Yes I’d augment both and ensure you include some of the augments in val, but I would probably include whole classes of augments in val, e.g. class 1, image x + all augments thereof go in val. Otherwise you’re going to have data leakage between the two sets. \n\nYou might also consider adding additional augmentation methods, like adding small random noise to the images to help flatten out the decision surfaces, provided the images aren’t so sensitive that you’ll screw everything up if you do.",
        "If I understand it correctly, you want to classifiy every single slice whether it is tumorous or not, or am I wrong? What is the purpose of lesion here?",

This may be different for you with more data.\n\nAre you building/working with LLMs? Cheapest option for big models is Mac with high memory (Mac Studio, MacBook Pro) because you can designate most of the unified memory towards gpu memory. Smaller models (8b ish) will run fine on 24gb.\n\nIf you aren’t working with lots of LLM or lots of data in general, you are already in overkill for your build. It’s not a bad thing though, you’ll be able to do basically anything with it. Game, school, 3d stuff (cad, blender), video editing all at very high speed.\n\nIf you’ll be compiling large libraries from source code (you might, I’ve done this a few times when working with ML) you may like the higher core CPUs better like 7950x3d or 9950x. It’s not a big deal though. If you don’t find yourself in situations where compiling something takes more than say, a minute, then you don’t need more speed.",

If you want to learn the foundations I'd argue that learning on smaller tasks initially is likely to be more productive anyway."

Dev kit is like $400-500, but it’s probably the minimum viable hardware for realtime detection. \n\nIf you’re running realtime detection on multi spec data you may even need a beefier jetson \n\nRaspberry pi just won’t have enough juice.

Maybe try with regular image detection first? \n\nThe core issue of course is physical occlusion of the weeds by the crops. That won’t be solved with multi spectral imaging any more than it would with regular old RGB. For that you’d likely need green lidar, which is out of the scope of this project.",

The frameworks are normally model agnostic so if you train your own you could potentially use just about any framework and model combo you can imagine.\n\nFastRCNN, fasterRCNN, SSD (single shot detection) are all some well established alternatives to YOLO. If you can't train your your model, you might want to look at zero shot detection models. There seems to be one that can be used readily on huggingface.",

However, this model only requires binary image level labels, meaning you just need separate your images into a pile of images without weeds, and a pile of images with weeds. There are a few more tweaks, for things like image size and so on. And this model only uses one bounding box size, as currently written. For an overhead view that might be enough, but that may not work out at an eye level view. \n\n\n\nLet me know if you try it out.",

If those channels are captured by one lens, that's probably fine. If a different process is used, merging multiple captures, then that's more complicated to tell whether its appropriate for each channel. Its usually fine, though.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m working on a personal GPT -related project that aims to identify misinformation within academic content. The idea is to use GPT-2 XL to examine claims within academic texts and generate outputs that go beyond simple classification, providing more contextually relevant content.\n\nFor example, if a claim in a research paper states that “a specific drug has been proven effective in treating a disease,” the model would use the text of other academic papers relevant to the topic and generate a detailed output that either supports or refutes the claim based on the evidence, with a brief explanation. The idea is to use a sliding window to analyze the text content of the other research papers in order to conform to the text-input limitations.\n\nI only have access to an RTX GeForce 3060 GPU (12 GB of memory), and while GPT-2 XL runs efficiently on my setup, I’ve noticed that the output quality is rather poor.\n\nI’m considering fine-tuning GPT-2 XL on a custom dataset focused on academic language and misinformation to improve its performance for this specific task. However, I’m concerned about the feasibility given my limitations.\n\nIs it possible/practical to fine-tune GPT-2 XL on an RTX 3060 for this purpose, or would the process be too computationally expensive?\n",

    "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI currently have a classification task, except I use an object detection model. The model outputs detections for all objects it locates in the image, and assigns a confidence to each. However, I am only interested in classifying the entire image as one class, so I will need to perform some postprocessing.\n\nI first have a vector of K threshold values, one for each class, and I threshold all confidences such that if a confidence is less than the corresponding class threshold, I clamp it to zero (essentially deleting the detection).\n\nI also have a vector of K class weights, one for each class, and I multiply all confidences by the corresponding value. This is used to “re-order” the confidences so to improve the accuracy. For example, a certain class could be detected with low confidences by the model, but is a high priority for the user (such that when it appears, the user would always want the image to be classified as it).\n\nI currently have the mathematical problem where I want to find the optimal values for both the thresholds and the weights, such that with these new parameters, I can alter the confidences such that the highest accuracy is achieved (the highest confidence detection, after thresholding/weighting, in each image coincides with the ground truth).\n\nI know that this scheme runs a lot of risks with regards to overfitting, or that accuracy is not the best metric when the dataset is well-balanced, etc. but I am purely interested in this as a mathematical question.\n\nCurrently, for the weight optimization, I am running a gradient descent algorithm using a binary cross-entropy loss. I use binary cross entropy because I cannot handle the “None” (no detections) class using regular cross-entropy, as far as I know (please correct me if I’m wrong). This works with decent results.\n\nBut I am not sure how to optimize the thresholds, as it’s non-differentiable, short of using a brute-force or heuristic algorithm like genetic algorithm or grid search. I have tried using an iterative local search but it is slow and is slow to improve.\n\nI’ve been struggling with this problem for a while, and any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks!",

For detection step, if you're looking for a model that's easy to use, r/Ultralytics has YOLOv8 that's pretty easy to use and with the right dataset, will be easy to train.

        "The attention equation is permutation ~~invariant~~ equivariant, meaning that if you shuffle the input sequence you get the output sequence shuffled in the same way. In order to break this equivariance, you need to incorporate into the sequence elements information related to the position within the sequence. Let me elaborate:\n\nThe way to think about it is like this: the attention mechanisms outputs a new sequence of vectors where each vector is a weighted average of (a linear projection of each element of) the original sequence of \"value\" vectors. The weighting is according to how similar (dot product) is each \"query\" vector to each \"key\" vector. In self-attention all these sequences of vectors refer to the same sequence.\n\nThe learned parameters of the attention mechanisms are the projection matrices, W\\_q, W\\_k, W\\_v, which project the input vectors (X, X, X - in case of self-attention)  into Q=X W\\_q, etc (each vector is a row in a matrix).\n\nattn(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK')V / sqrt(dim) - where dim is the number of dimensions the vectors are projected to\n\nNote that the same W\\_q, W\\_k and W\\_v is applied to all vectors of the respective sequences, regardless of what position  - THIS IS THE PERMUTATION ~~INVARIANCE~~ EQUIVARIANCE\n\nSo the only way to have different attention weights, or different projected values depending on the sequence position is to either add or concatenate positional information to each input vector x.\n\nMakes sense?\n\nEDIT: the attention operation is permutation equivariant, since the output is a sequence, in other words self\\_attention(perm(x)) = perm(self\\_attention(x)).",
        "\"Why can't the model simply learn word order from the data and adjust its weights accordingly during backpropagation?\"\n\nYou're right, you can totally do that.\n\nThis is done in GPT2 for instance, where position enconding is learned directly by the model. [ It seems that the learned position manifold can be projected into an helix.](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qvWP3aBDBaqXvPNhS/gpt-2-s-positional-embedding-matrix-is-a-helix) We can observe things similar to the \"hard-coded\" sines and cosines. The issue is that it would probably be very expensive for very large context as the position embedding matrix would be as large as the full context....",
        "Good question!\n\nTry reading this paper: [Transformer Language Models without Positional Encodings Still Learn Positional Information[arxiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16634)",
        "That's a very reasonable question! I think there are 2 reasons:\n\n1. Transformers could work without pos-emb, just the answer might be different depending on permutation of the tokens. Example: \"You must learn to use the Force - said ... (answer: Luke Skywalker)\", \"Force learn to use you must - said ... (Master Yoda)\". But seriously, if we think if transformers' inputs beyond words, just as generic sequences then it becomes clearer.\n2. Transformers already need to figure out a lot of things as they don't inherit a lot of biases. They are famously data-hungry. So we are trying to make things \"easier\" for them to learn faster.\n\nBut I do wish that original paper made ablation study what happens if you don't include positional embeddings. Using different positional embeddings is a popular applied-research question and you would be welcome to contribute to it by experimenting with either no positional embeddings, or some other way of letting the model know the order of tokens.\n\n  \nThis paper: [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11063-024-11539-7](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11063-024-11539-7)  \nDoesn't exactly explore what would happen if you didn't add any pos-emb, however dives deeper into it's role in transformers, so might be a good starting point for thinking about the problem",
        "See the Transformer starts training,it takes all the tokens in parallel and does Computing using Multi Head Attention for effective use of GPU but here it's just data it doesn't have any kind of order in.\n\nThe model doesn't know which one comes after which but in sequential models like LSTM you feed the data in Sequential manner so the lstm models know the order of the words or tokens.\n\nThat's why what they did is they removed the sequential manner in the transformer which was taking computation time and added Parallelization by introducing Multi Head Attention but In order to give order of the tokens they added Positional encodings.\n\nBy adding Positional embeddings ,the Data is converted into sine and cosine wave format in which the data can be stored it as frequency which is position information across the sequence.\n\n\nWithout positional embedding,the model gets the attention for all the words but it doesn't know in which order to place them while generating the output.",
        "It needs to keep track of the order of words because that is how it knows that there is a sequence of probabilities.\n\nDuring prediction, you predict the NEXT word. The model wouldn't understand what NEXT means if you didn't somehow capture the idea of sentence position in the training. Aside from positional encoding, the tokens are all processed \"at once\" in parallel.",
        "Transformer Decoders will work without position encoding due to the causal nature (masking). Having position encoding just makes it perform better, though there are claims otherwise. https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19466\n\nHistorically it was added because the Transformer's Encoder component needed it, otherwise “chicken eats man” and “man eats chicken” would be the same, and the Decoder's translation would vary very differently.",
        "Have you read anything about RoPE (Rotary Positional Embedding)?\nIt is a breakthrough that seeks to eliminate absolute positional embeddings(it is used in Llama 3.1).",
        "Close, but not quite.\n\nThe attention mechanism is permutation equivariant, not invariant to row permutations of the query matrix. If P is a permutation matrix then\n\nattention(PQ, K, V) = softmax(PQK\\^T / sqrt{d})V = P softmax(QK\\^T / sqrt{d})V = P attention(Q, K, V).\n\nSo if you change the order of the queries, you are going to get the embeddings but shuffled around. This is equivariance. Moreover, this is not a result of the use of the same projection matrices for all inputs. These are just learnable parameters used to learn different alignment processes in different subspaces in MHA. The equivariance of the attention mechanism holds regardless of the projections as shown above.",
        "Great explanation! Do we need to add the pos embedding when training on Time series data ? Like weather etc since that type of data is inherently ordinal.",
        "This is the answer. To put it sharply, the sum/average operation is commutative (QK^T ) - so even if you permuted all your inputs you’d get the same result. This means the network cannot see order of inputs past this operation.",
        "Well explained bro.\n\n\nCan u DM you for some advice?",
        "My confusion is regarding the purpose of Pos emb. Like we aren't even passing it as a separate thing while training for the model to infer some kind of relation. \nWe are adding it with the embeddings and passing it directly. \nIf the model can learn the patterns(essentially decode the pos emb pattern), why can't it simply learn the relationship b/w the tokens without it?\n\n\nAlso, the trained vocabulary inherently embed the positional encoding as possible emb is a part of input for self attention. But while generating answer, what use is this information when the model needs to output something totally different from what it was trained on. ",
        "I understand the logic behind having positional encodings, but initially during training the model knows nothing about pos enc as it hasn't been trained yet.   If the model can pick out sinusoidal/cosine waves pattern from the token embeddings and interpret it as positions, it can as well do it simply with attention mechanism right?\n\nWhat I mean to say is during attention mechanism, a token learns the relationship b/w all other tokens in the context. This learned relationship can be used as the next token predictor without pos emb right?\n\nFor instance if I give it the input \"the dog is....\" The model will come up with probability distributions of tokens and the most likely token that would fit the case would be barking, running and etc thanks to attention mechanism. \n\nI don't see what pos emb do in this case.  Either I'm missing a subtle basic point or I do not understand the topic at all.  ",
        "But the idea of position during training atleast is not inherently known by the model right? \nIf it learns to pick up the patterns, it can as well predict the words based on probability distributions of next token right?",
        "This has been the crux of problem for me to understand. \nIf the model doesn't inherently know about positions and learns to use pos emb, it can as well do it with attention mechanism right?\n\n\nIt can simply use the probability distribution to predict which word is most likely to come next and that would it. ",
        "Let's consider self-attention. Yes, technically we are talking about equivariance, relative to the sequence of input vectors X (a matrix where each row is a vector).  \nself-attention(perm(x)) = perm(self-attention(x))\n\n>The attention mechanism is permutation equivariant, not invariant to row permutations of the query matrix.\n\nI didn't mean it's invariant to row permutations of the query matrix, I meant that the calculated value of an output vector at a specific position is invariant to the ordering of input vectors at the other positions. For example, if we hold the first vector of X the same but the rest of X is permuted, the first element of the attention operation will always have the same value regardless of the ordering of the other elements. But indeed, this is just a convoluted way of saying that it's permutation equivariant.\n\nNow, I haven't thought through what happens in case of cross-attention, when the X\\_k and X\\_v vectors are permuted, hmm....",
        "What do you mean by ordinal?",
        "Hmm, honestly I'm not sure what do you mean by \"we aren't even passing it as a separate thing while training...\" - we do, right? Even more than that, in some use-cases you can send ONLY positional embeddings without proper queries if you want to project output of self attention.\n\n\"Trained vocabulary inherently embed the positional encoding as possible emb is a part of input for self attention\" - again, I'm not 100% sure what do you mean by \"trained vocabulary\", but each token is first embedded separately (without knowledge of it's position) and then added pos-emb before getting into self-attention. Now, during inference we do exact same thing - sometimes we want to predict next token, sometimes some token in the middle. Depending on which token you want to predict (information about that will be encoded via pos-emb) the answer might be different.",
        "Yes, without position encoding, a decoder will learn what the next token is simply from the training process due to the causal masking. \n\nIt just didn't work for encoder-decoders because if \"man eats chicken\" and \"chicken eats man\" were entered into the encoder (the encoder sees the ENTIRE sentence, not one token after another), the encoder will pass the same tensor (for the two sentences) to the decoder, and the decoder will likely be guessing at 50% chance the translation.",
        "Ah, I see what you're saying! Indeed, every output embedding being invariant to permutations of the input sequence implies equivariance. \n\nInterestingly, what we're discussing is a manifestation of a more general geometric deep learning principle often seen in GNNs. Given nodes with certain embeddings x\\_1, ..., x\\_m collected in a matrix X, and an adjacency matrix A determining the graph's connectivity, we denote the embeddings of a node's neighbours as X\\_{N\\_1}, ... X\\_{N\\_m}. Then, a GNN layer F updates these embeddings as F(X, A) = \\[φ(x\\_1, X\\_{N\\_1}, ...., φ(X\\_m, X\\_{N\\_m})\\]\\^T. As long as φ is permutation invariant, F will be permutation equivariant as required. \n\nAnd since transformers are simply fully connected Graph Attention Networks (GATs) with positional encoding, if you remove positional encoding you get the above described behaviour.",
        "So a model trained on a corpus of text with 50 tokens, will have embeddings for all those tokens with the information  of positional encoding within them. (This is because while training we add pos enco to the token embed).\n\n\nFor instance if the model is being trained on sentence \"the dog is barking\", the positional enco of tokens gets added to its embeddings.\nSo when the training is complete, the embed of token say \"dog\" will have positional enco deep in them. ",
        "So you're saying that the model knows how to interpret the sinusoidal/cosine waves pattern as position even before it's trained?\nIf that is the case then I understand. ",
        "The model learns from the training. How it is trained (with casual masking or with position encoding) imbues it the concept of position after it sees the data multiple times"

    "selftext": "I'm not that experienced in the realm of ANN yet, so I hope the question is not totally off-chart :)\n\nI have come across the fact that neural networks are initialized with random values for their weights and biases to ensure that the values won't be initialized neither on the same or symmetrical values.\n\nI completely understand why they cannot be the same - all but one node would be redundant.\n\nThe thing I cannot wrap my head around is why they must not be symmetrical. I have not found a single video about it on YouTube and GPT lowkey told me, when I kept asking why not, that if you have a range of relevant weights (let's say -10 to 10), it, in fact, is better to initialize them as far from each other as possible, rather than using one of the randomness algorithms.\n\nThe only problem GPT mentioned with this is the delivery of perfectly detached nodes.\n\nCan anyone explain to me why then everyone uses random initialization?",

        "Not sure what gpt meant by far as possible, NN weights are usually initialized using normal distribution, which is both symmetrical and places most weights close together at around 0. Where did you read about symmetrical values in weights?",
        "Can you clarify what you mean with „must not be symmetrical“?\n\nBeside that. Here is another way to think of it. You are on a mountain and you let a few balls roll down. Wouldn’t it be smart to choose different/random positions in the mountain to ensure they take different paths downhill?",
        "There's not a big literature behing parameter initialization strategies, unfortunately.\n\nFor parameters initialized with the same value (e.g. zero), as you correctly said, the parameters of the units would be updated with the same value and compute the same function, making it redundant.\n\nThe second point, useless and irrelevant, it's an interesting one about weight values, but has little impact on the underlying theory.\n\nThe next part is more theoretic and requires some knowledge of the *weight-space symmetries*.\n\nOne interesting fact about ANNs is that multiple choices of the weights can converge to the same input-output mapping. Take for example an ANN where we switch the sign of each of the **W** weights in a specific hidden layer with *tanh* activation (this is not inherently associated with *tanh*, but can be extended to a variety of activation functions (Kurková, Keinen 1994)). Since *tanh* is an odd function, *tanh(-x) = -tanh(x)*, thus changing the sign of the activation, but now we can compensate this by changing the sign of all the weights leading out of that units, leading to the previous point, we are led to the same mapping function! So, for **W** hidden units, there are **2\\^W** equivalent weight vectors.\n\nSame thing happens if we permute hidden units: for **W** units in a layer, we have **W!** possible equivalent permutations, giving rise to a symmetry factor equal to **2\\^W \\* W!**.\n\nNow: theory is not going to explain much further than this, but my intuition is that, given those symmetries on the whole layer, there could be a case of piecewise symmetries that can lead to redundant learning: Imagine an ANN with single-unit output layer and a hidden layer with *tanh* activation function. Let's suppose the hidden layer with 2k units gets initialized with two identical sets of weight of length k, first for weights from 0 to k-1, second for weights from k to 2k-1. Those two subsets would learn the same mapping too due to the same error propagations!\n\nRandomizing from a uniform distribution *U\\[-t,t\\]* or a zero-mean Gaussian *N(0, t\\^2)* with a sensible choice of *t* (He et al, 2015b) avoids these shenanigans, so you're good to go.\n\nEDIT: My point is not only valid for a dichotomic repetition of the weights in the hidden unit. Of course the same case can happen for smaller subsets, even non-adjacent ones.",
        "Can you paste exactly the entire paragraph you read about symmetry? It is possible that you misunderstood what it meant.\n\nI speculate that the symmetry you read is not with regards to the sampling function for weight initialization, but rather regarding the output of all neurons will be symmetrical, if not for random weight initialization, due to having equal gradients.\n\nI always tell people: NNs are really genius at approximating any function, despite relying on one of the dumbest optimization methods, that is the gradient descent",
        "why are the networks initiated randomly at all? Because they are point neutral networks, not Bayesian models. There is no random initialization in Bayesian models because it's learning/inference by marginalization. There is no such thing in neural networks, and the weights can't be 0.0 because then it wouldn't learn anything. It is also usually not possible to initialize the parameters with the x vectors of the training set.\nSo the only way out is to initialize randomly. \n\nBreaking of symmetry is explained in another great response here.",
        "Another interesting perspective given by Johnson-Lindenstrauss and Restricted Isometry Property is that random projections are extremely likely to preserve the original geometry given certain realistic assumptions. So if you want to initialize in a way such that information has a good chance to propagate through the whole net but you don't want to assume much about the data, gaussian iid noise is a pretty good way to achieve this",

        "That's a great question actually :)  \nI can't tell exactly anymore, but the theme recured through multiple blog posts, podcasts and other sources too, along with GPT (so it has to have some presence on the interent).\n\nThe weights and biases of the NN being symmetrically initialized is new to me - do you have any video or post I could read why is that an effective method?",
        "First to clarify: From what I have heard, everyone is saying that the randomness is brought into picture to break the symmetry and I don't understand why are people trying that.\n\nWhy would you not use something of a grid, rather than random, I suppose?\n\n(not that I would not like randomness, but I just can't tell why is it better :D)",

        "OK... so what does it mean to be symettical? \n\nWhat symettry generally means is that you can do something to something, and the end result is identical to the start. Like, rotate a squate by 90deg, or reflect it in a line through its corners. (\"Invariant under...\" means \"doesn't change when you...\")\n\nIf you have a tensor of weights, W, and an operator S, then\n\nSW = W, if W is symettrical with respect to S\n\nWhen you are optimising you are trying to minimise the loss as a function of the elements of W. We can write the loss LW, and the derivative wrt to any single element, x of W, is (d/dx)(LW).\n\nS(d/dx)(LW) = S(dL/dx)W + SL(dW/dx)\n\n If the loss function is symettic wrt S (which it almost always will be), then \n\nS(d/dx)(LW) = (d(SL)/dx)W + SL(dW/dx) = (d/dx)(SLW) = (d/dx)(LW)\n\nIn other words, the derivative of the loss is symettical. In which case your search direction will be, and all your updates to W will be. \n\nThe effect of which is to contrain your optimisation search to sests of weights which have the same symmetry as your original weights.",
        "Not sure about video specifically but you can read about Xavier or He initializations",
        "I think you’re reading too much into this.\n\nThe main problem is you want the weights to start at 0, but you can’t since then the gradients will be the same (like you said). So, you initialize them really close to 0, while still getting each weight to trend toward different values, because of the noise you added to them.\n\nIt might be easier to visualize the other way around. Initialize each weight to 0, and when you apply the gradient add a tiny bit of noise to each gradient for each weight. This also solves the problem of the weights having the same gradient.\n\nThe only “symmetry” there is is that the average of the initialized weights should be zero, but like I explained before it’s not for the sake of symmetry, it’s because you want them to *be* zero but you can’t.\n\nHope this helps. I’d recommend you read about various regularization techniques like L2 and dropout. I think that would help your intuition regarding why we even have “initialization” methods at all.",
        "I just told why it is better. You are solving an optimization problem. So to minimize this you would like to find those weights that make your loss function minimal. If all your starting weights start from the same position. They end up doing the same, therefore you just distribute them across the parameter space",
        "You're welcome! Can I tell you something? But please don't feel attacked by this: try not using chatGPT!

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,  \nI am new to all of this and have been using PyTorch for a couple weeks, and I have been set a task as a part of a project. This task is to create a deep learning model, or series of models, which when given a 3 x n input vector, can produce a output vector of 9 numbers which pertain to the initial input. For example, the first number of the output vector is the number of rows of the input vector, and the second number is the highest number in the input vector. From my research, I have struggled to find any problems similar to this and as a result I am not sure what to do. My approach thus far has been to create 9 models, each trained to output 1 of the 9 numbers. So far my only success has been that i produced an lstm model which was successfully able to output the number of rows of the input matrix. However currently I am unable to produce an effective model to output any of the rest of the numbers. If anybody could give me any advice as to how to classify and approach this problem or tell me what I am doing wrong it would be a massive help. Also I am happy to provide any code or data necessary Thanks ",

Yet, generally I have software engineering background. \n\nFirst things first - LLMs aren’t “AI” they are ML models in the purest form. Every aspect of them was known for ages.\n\nLLMs are just a tool in a tool box. For some stuff you use linear regression, for other stuff you use LLM.\n\nLLMs are great at NLP tasks. More correct statement word embeddings are amazing since they enable rich semantics. LLMs make accessible complex stuff to wide audience at price of lesser accuracy. For example things like sentiment analysis can be done now by non ML engineers. \n\nLLMs are merely a fraction of “AI track” (whatever that supposed to mean), like 5%. If you don’t have NLP tasks you won’t benefit from them much.\n\nField is very hype because it made simple what previously was accessible exclusively to massive companies with big ML teams. \n\nIt will burst spectacularly, and at the end of it we will have just one more great “algorithm” to solve particular tasks.\n\nEdit: LLMs in production are just a little fraction of the whole logic.

        "I get your point, \"AI\" is the most diluted term of the past couple years. Before all this hype you'd have way less job listings related to the field. However, most of them would not mention AI but a specific field where AI was applied. You can think of Computer Vision Engineer, NLP Engineer etc. Nowadays you see way more companies having these openings for AI position but it is very rare that they know what they are actually looking for. From my experience, most of the time the role is for a SWE that has some experience with LLM APIs. However, there are still companies where you genuinely work on Machine Learning. \n\nThe guy in the post talks about FAANG and other big companies and while I agree that those are the places to go if you wanna do pure research, that is not the only side of ML. I work for a small company where I would consider myself something like an applied scientist for ML. This usually means that you have a very specific problem for which you need to do some research to solve it. Research scientists on the other hand, research on solving more general problems and try to push the state of the art forward.\n\nAnother point I agree with the poster is that the situation really is unbearable. I came in the field more than 5 years ago because I fell in love with it and to me it was a really cool application of mathematics to try to advance science. Unfortunately now though there are so many hype bros and grifters that I feel people are starting to take the field less seriously just because of that. \n\nWith that said, I would suggest you think why you got in the field in the first place. If you genuinely like what it is about and want to pursue it, I would suggest you keep going. If you bought a bit into the hype I would suggest you take into consideration that in the hype cycle for \"AI\" we are kinda at the point where we go from \"Peak of Inflated Expectations\" to \"Trough of Disillusionment\" so it might be harder to progress in the field without a lot of dedication in the near future. \n\nBest of luck :)",

Advancement in AI has without a shadow of a doubt (imo) peaked the interest of the highest levels of government all across the world. We are in the middle of an era similar to the Oppenheimer Manhattan Project era.  \n  \nJust as the Manhattan Project was a pivotal moment in history, shaping global power dynamics and introducing new ethical and existential dilemmas, AI is now at a similar crossroads. Undoubtedly driven through similar government projects. The technology has the potential to bring about unprecedented changes in society, from revolutionizing industries to raising profound questions about the nature of intelligence, autonomy, and control.\n\nLike the Manhattan Project, the rapid advancement of AI is driven by intense competition, this time not only between nations but also between corporations - all vying for leadership in this transformative (pun intended) field. The stakes are high, with the potential for AI to be used in both constructive and destructive ways. On the constructive side, AI could solve complex problems in medicine, climate change, and many other areas. On the destructive side, it could be weaponized, leading to new forms of warfare, surveillance, and social manipulation.\n\nJust as the development of nuclear weapons led to a global recognition of the need for regulation and control, there is growing awareness that AI, too, must be guided by ethical principles and robust governance. The consequences of failing to do so could be as far-reaching and irreversible as those faced in the nuclear age.",

Still, there are useful applications for it. I’m thinking, as an example, control of NPCs in games, assisting autopilot in self driving vehicles (still quite some work to do), navigation, forecasting, satellite imagery segmentation, time series prediction (e.g. failure case time prediction, but also smart agriculture). In general, whenever a task is too complex or have too many variables in it, ML/DL can be used. Otherwise, it’s just pompous and hyped bullshit.\n\nAlso, I partly agree with the thoughts on LLMs: they are amazing at what they do, and it’s very interesting to study why they work. Yet, throwing LLMs at everything (current state of academia, but also current trend in industry it seems) just does not make sense for me: they have problems yet not understood and, at the end of the day, they are simply amazing next word predictors based on context.

        "Yeah no, you are naive in humans’ desire to do the necessary verification. In my country, The Netherlands, a judge recently used ChatGPT as the basis for a verdict. The information ended up being wrong, and is a super scary precedence. \n\nI have absolute no hope in humanity having the diligence to verify information produced by AI.",
        "my comment was not about layoffs. If you leave only skeletal crew using AI to deliver their product or service, you have nothing left for expansion\n\nInstead of firing people we would be able to do much more work. Churning the backlog and removing technical debt would be worth much more than firing people. Using AI instead could harm development of the company. \n\nRecent layoffs in tech are mostly a result of pursuing short-term profits to satisfy shareholders. This, and overhiring during the -vid, which also was for chasing short-term profits",
        "Thats definitely scary, but I also think the liability should be on the users of the information in such instances. A judge who used Google or Wikipedia would be just as liable without invalidating the use case of either platform. \n\nI think LLMs for teaching coding and other STEM concepts is great tbh"

        "Very cool idea. Will try to understand the math a bit more later.",
        "Thanks! Feel free to ask us any questions on discord https://discord.com/invite/aFsCgDraGP",
        "Thanks! If I were to paraphrase/summarize, let me know if I’m getting the main point:\n\n1. Linear attention tries to make the break apart QK^T interaction so that K interacts with V first, reducing dimensionality. It does this by essentially removing the softmax nonlinearity and perhaps replacing it with a pre-nonlinearity in Q and K separately (“pre” to still retain associativity). This replacement is an approximation because mathematically we don’t have a kernel phi such that phi(Q)phi(K)^T is exactly softmax(QK^T ) and empirically has been found to perform poorly, perhaps due to that weakness.\n\n2. Your main idea is that a) the nonlinearity doesn’t have to be softmax - it can be any nonlinearity that satisfies a few properties, so let’s say it’s (QK^T )^(p) b) such a proposed nonlinearity is actually decomposable into pre-transforms on Q and K individually. So together you have identified a nonlinearity with an exact decomposition rather than an approximation. Empirically you find that p=4 is the smallest number where this performs well. However, naively, the space of your kernel embedding is d^p , which even for p=4 is too large to realize practical benefits on modern hardware.\n\n3. Examining a bit further you can see that this specific form is highly compressible, and in a highly structured way (most of the entries are repeated). Further you find that at p=4, you happen to have a sweet spot in the sizing that both perform well and is a practical improvement.\n\nIs this correct? If so I’d be very interested to see those cuda tricks implemented (happy to help out if you like) and how well this works in much longer context problems. It seems that your benchmark of “improving over softmax attention” only needs to be “just hit”, because you are able to now scale independent of context length, is that right?\n\nAnd a further comment. You likely don’t actually need an exact kernel to nonlinearity equivalence for the architecture to perform well. It seems like if there’s some form that approximates softmax well or x^p well with some favorable tradeoffs in size, that’s just as good (maybe better). Have there been much work in looking for that? Either in your group or in general population?"
